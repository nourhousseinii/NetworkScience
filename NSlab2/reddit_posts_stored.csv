Nope. Maui Hawaii got $700 per resident.

Our leaders do not give a fuck about Climate Change. If they cared about Climate Change they would use East Palestine and Maui as extreme examples of the Climate rapidly changing under man’s leadership. But nope that quickly disappears because it makes Biden’s leadership in disaster recovery look bad. The climate is irreversibly damaged in those areas because of man made Climate Change. And yet nothing.

26,179v3ji,2023-10-17,conspiracy,"Are they trying to start a war with Iran, is that the bigger picture here?","I am far from an expert in any of this stuff but I have been watching all these wars and other global events taking place over the last twenty years and I think I have just figured out what is going. This is probably going to sound really stupid but I'm going t give it a go anyway.

You see it has always been my understanding that these wars have all been individual events that have come about independent from each other from there own different reasons. Iraq was a separate event from Afghanistan, air strikes on Sierra where separate attacks, drone strikes in Yemen etc. But now I'm starting to wonder if they are all connected to a larger plan. What if what has been happening has been a decades long strategy to take out major players in the Middle East and perhaps Russia.

I know this is coming from someone who probably has no idea what they are talking about but here me out. For instance lets say USA want to take out Iran which is the largest military power in the Middle East. Would the strategy be to directly invade Iran's. Or would it be better to slowly and subtly destabilize the region of many years, weaken Iran's allies before going in? Also if you are going to take out Russia isn't it best to take out their allies first? Again it is not about completely taking out countries all they have to do is significantly weaken them before moving on to the next one.

The narrative is Afghanistan was a disaster, but was it, what if it the whole war in Afghanistan wasn't about winning but just about weakening it enough so it would no longer be a threat and a strong enough force to assist Iran. They did the same in Iraq, they didn't need to conquer it, they just needed to weaken it. 

Destabilize Iraq, then destabilize Afghanistan. destabilize Syria, destabilize Yemen. 

Then COVID. What if COVID was a biological attack to further weaken multiple nations in preparation for the next move.

As soon as COVID is over like clockwork Russia attacks Ukraine. Is it possible the US baited Russia into attacking Ukraine. Initiate a proxy war to deplete Russian resources and military but not to go into Russia but to make it more difficult for them to support Iran?

And now this attack in Israel. Why is the USA's largest aircraft carrier and other ships heading into the region. Israel does not need US assistance to take out Hamas. Israel is not what people think it is. Israel is posing as a Jewish state but actually it is the USA's largest military base outside of America. Israel and the USA are one and the same. Israel is the USA's main strategic position in the Middle East. Now Hamas attack Israel and Israel declares war on Palestine. But this is not really about Palestine, this is about baiting Iran into a war. They have been trying for years to bait Iran into a war, they can't just go in there without a reason, remember they need to manufacture consent, they do not start wars without a large majority of public support - attack on pearl harbor, weapons of mass destruction, 9/11. problem reaction solution.

So I think everything that has happened over the last three decades or even more has been an ongoing strategy to take out the Middle East, to destabilize the entire region and Iran is next. They are all playing Risk and US is winning.

― Honoré de Balzac, Père Goriot

What I have seen in this thread and on reddit this week is absurdly insane. It’s as if people are emotionally numb or as if we went from being “advanced and civilized “ to becoming a mere “civilized barbaric creatures ”  

It’s utterly inhumane to choose a side or to consider this as a conflict or a war because it’s a f***** genocide.  

Let me break it for you cause I have seen some dumb shit especially from the Americans who are the last people to utter a word in such cases ( I recall someone writing an essay here claiming that Hamas misfired a missle then said his source is the CNN 🤡🦅) 

What’s happening right now in Gaza is a never ending vicious cycle. I am an agnostic arab and I have researched and studied the Palestinian case for a long time and I have always named the Israel- Hamas conflict as a wash-rinse-repeat cycle. 
Hamas a paramilitary group that was born after the first Intifada in 1987. The Palestinian Islamist group, Hamas, took full control of Gaza in 2007, ousting Palestinian Authority (PA) security forces in days of bloody fighting, a year after Hamas won the Palestinians' last parliamentary election. 
Following its takeover, Israel and Egypt imposed a tight blockade against the militants which has squeezed the Palestinian territory. Internationally, Hamas is widely seen as a terrorist group.
So the last election was in 2007 and if that doesn’t ring a bell to you I don’t know what will. I will explain right away what I mean by this : 

People don’t actually know that there was a popular discontent with the Hamas regime in Gaza that has been simmering for years. Since the group wrested control of the coastal strip from the Fatah-run Palestinian Authority in 2007, large-scale protests have taken place on several occasions, most recently in April 2015, January 2017 and again in 2019. Each time, protests were repressed by Hamas security forces and did not lead to any significant changes for the local population. 
( I will mention all my sources under the thread) 

The part that everyone is aware of and blindly ignoring is that the creation of an extremist Islamic group in Palestine against an extremist Zionist regime is necessary to the plans of the west in the middle east and to the ethnic cleansing agenda of Benjamin Netanyahu. 
In simpler words, hatred breeds hatred and extremism breeds extremism. 
We all know USA created AL QAEDA an extremist islamic group to achieve its agenda in Pakistan and Iraq.
We all know who created ISIS another extremist group who suits their agenda in Syria, Libya and Yemen.. So if you ever think that Hamas is an actual resistance or a paramilitary party that truly cares for it’s people then you are either dumb or dumb.

I will mention below some videos and articles and interviews in which the Palestinians fiercely protesting and condemning Hamas.

So back to the Wash-Rinse-Repeat cycle
Hamas the extremist group funded by Qatar and Israel attacks incompetently causing casualties in the occupied territories; Israel welcomes the attack and retaliates with triple to four times more damage to the Gaza civilians who are already living in a prison in the most dire conditions in one of the most densely populated area in the whole world. The UN and the 💩🦅 say that Israel had the right to defend herself ( see I didn’t say that the number of casualties in Israel is always few to none compared to Gazans because every human being must be valued but this is unfortunately, statistically and historically backed and you can check that on your own) 
After tens and hundreds of houses get demolished and after hundreds of civilians get massacred in Gaza while Hamas leaders are enjoying their luxurious lifestyle in Turkey and away from the open air prison and while a criminal regime is being backed and hailed by the US & Europe. The UN as usual and after few f***** negotiations a cease fire is implemented just to stand for few months to be broken again by Hamas who will attack again and the cycle repeats itself. 
Also note that the zionist regime has been attacking civilians for decades now and on a daily basis and they strive on the existence of Hamas to justify their annexation agenda and their brutality and atrocities. 

History repeats itself always and forever and what’s happening currently is a modern day holocaust. 
A racist sociopath Hitler and Netanyahu conduct unjustified mass murders motivated by their manic and ethnic cleansing agenda against ( jew / slavs) ( arabs/ Muslims). 
The first one was backed by the Nazi ideology and Europe at that time and since Anti-Semitism existed for almost two millennia prior the rise of Hitler ( a simple example: in the bubonic plague the jews suffered less than the christian neighbors in Europe and for that they were accused of poisoning Europe ) They were also considered as abad omen and conspirators prior the rise of Nazis so everyone especially the British and the French backed the idea of massacring them or expelling them out of Europe. 
Same goes with the second as the criminal pig Netanyahu is getting backed and funded by Europe and the USA to annexate and ethnically cleanse the territory. He even uttered publicly that his plan is to eradicate Gaza and make it a new settlement.",AccomplishedCoast982,t2_rgyfb0lh,0.68,505,341

He never goes against Israeli policies it seems. I get it he's Jewish but still I've heard him rail against every country but Israel.

30,173soqv,2023-10-09,conspiracy,All wars are banker wars.,"This might be one of the most important documentaries that anyone can watch right now given current events and escalations between Hamas, Israel, Iran, and the US. 

All wars are bankers wars.

If you are still caught up in the left vs right, Israel vs Palestine, Ukraine vs Russia narratives, treating geopolitics and war as if it's a football game where you are rooting for one side to win as the real moral authority, then you need to take 45 minutes out of your day to watch this in full.

I've shared this documentary ( https://youtu.be/BrKf9nYeXT0?si=g6SfVbOqKTU5Syb4) already weeks ago and a lot of people saw it and appreciated it, but I think it's now more important than ever for as many people to see it as possible and to really understand the profound and eye opening truth behind those words, and how EVERY SINGLE conflict has had powers above it funding both sides with nefarious intent behind it and a broader agenda that is not in the true interests of the people.

I don't think any of what's happening right now is organic. I don't think Hamas getting into Israel to murder and capture civilians was a mistake, nor do I think the $6bil the Biden admin unfroze for Iran in exchange for hostages before the attack was a mistake either. They're constructing narratives right in front of us and we cannot just blindly believe them on surface level evaluation, especially when these narratives are being given by the establishment and MSM.

I've said this before and I'll say it again. You need to think like they do with strategy, perception, and propagandistic motivations in mind. You need to try and understand why they are presenting whatever information to the public and for what purpose. You need to question every action, every directive, every media spin.

Why is the narrative now shifting towards Biden admin causing this attack by releasing funds to Iran? Why is Lindsey Graham pre-emptively suggesting war with Iran in conjunction with this? What if this is designed to ensure Biden attacks Iran to cover his ass in giving them $6bil back? 

Also...Why was there such a huge focus of attention on anti-semitism on X in the weeks leading up to this attack? Was that organic? or was that planned in advance knowing there would be an attack on Israel and perceptions needed to be pre-emptively put in place for justifying censorship?

31,1782b0q,2023-10-14,conspiracy,Israel's 9/11- A False Flag,"Reasons why the recent attacks in Israel on Oct 7, 2023 were most likley a false flag attack that Israel knew about, let happen and could have even assisted.

Comparisons to 9/11, Pearl Harbour, etc are definetly relevant. 

1. Egypt warned Israel before the attacks that Hamas was planning something big and these repeated warnings were ignored

2. Hamas was a creation of Israel. They gave rise to this group to divide and conquer the Palestinians aka start a Fatah (West Bank) vs Hamas (Gaza) war to stop Palestinian unity 

3. According to several Israelis, experts on security/political matters relating to Israel and even former IDF soldiers, the Israeli border fence/region is heavily protected & surveilled. Some have suggested that not even a cockroach or fox could enter without them knowing. Yet somehow 2,500+ Hamas fighters, heavy equipment like bulldozers and tons of vehicles were able to slip through completely unnoticed

4. Israel & Gaza are amongst the most surveilled places on the planet. Israel dedicates a lot of time and effort upon surveillance and security. They are very security conscious. They have Gaza mapped out and under constant surveillance with highly advanced tech including a giant surveillance balloons, surveillance drones, satellites, sensors,etc 

5. Israel collaborates with Echelon & NATO. Chiefly amongst these groups, Israel has very close intel ties with the US which has eyes throughout the ME

6. Israel has one of the largest and most sophisticated spy networks in the world penetrating multiple enemy & even friendly nations with its spies/double agents 

7. Hamas is said to have been training for the attacks at a mock Israeli settlement near the Israeli-Gaza border region & Israel was aware of this

8. Israel and its warmongering ultra nationalist government was waiting for the perfect excuse to completely eliminate the Palestinian resistance and state. Now they have that excuse which is exactly what they wanted. Only a few months before the attacks, Netanyahu held up a map at the 2023 UN General Assembly in which there was no Palestine listed. Furthermore, Israel’s Finance Minister, Bezalel Smotrich, denied the existence of Palestine by saying, ""There is no Palestine"". Now they can make this a reality. They've annexed East Jerusalem, they've slowly taken control of the West Bank, settlement by settlement. Now all that's left is Gaza.

9. The attacks happened on the 50th anniversary of the Yom Kippur War. Israel would have been in an even more heightened state of alert at this time

10. These attacks happened at the perfect time for Israel/the Netanyahu gov. They happened at a time of internal turmoil caused by the 9+ months of protests/disunity due to the judicial reform. The Netanyahu coalition was teeter tottering. The judiciary in Israel had only recently started to hear cases associated with the judicial reform. Now, as a result of the attacks, there is no more disunity, no more protests and a new emergency, unity gov has been formed

11. The original Israeli response to the attack was very muted. Where were the border guards? Where was the police? Where was the IDF? How was Hamas able to act so freely in Southern Israel for so long & penetrate deep into Israeli territory? Even Hamas was surprised by how easy it was and how successful their operation was

12. Israel's intelligence/security agencies including Mossad, Shin Bet, Shayyrat 13, Yamam, Yamas, etc are amongst the world's best. There is no way no one amongst them didn't know what was coming

13. The Israelis are known to infiltrate Palestinian communities/territories with agents that are well versed in Arabic and Palestine's way of life. They have secretive units for this called Mista'arvim.
They are also known to have carried out attacks and then blamed the Palestinians for it. The King David Hotel Bombing comes to mind

14. Hamas was allegedly planning this attack for many months if not longer and we are expected to believe that Israel knew nothing about it this whole time

15. The site near the border with Gaza where the psychedelic rave/party took place was booked only two days beforehand after the previous location was called off. Attendees only found out the precise location a few hours before the event. This event happened near a hostile/tense border with minimal security

16. Israel recently confirmed for the first time that there were intelligence indications of something happening in Gaza two hours before the attacks last week.  The head of Shin Bet spoke with military personnel about the reports, said Tzachi Hanegbi, head of the National Security Council. Of course, as we already know, the Israelis knew well before this ""two hour"" window that something was up

17. It has recently come out that not only did Israel have intel beforehand but the US also had information before the attacks upon Israel and also ""failed"" to stop it 

18. It is being alleged that Michal Regev, the daughter of Miri Regev, a member of the Knesset, former Minister of Transport, former Minister of Culture and Sports, was a brigadier-general in the IDF and was also an IDF spokeswoman, was at the party/event held near the Gaza Strip and was warned by her mother to leave the party/event she was attending because an attack was imminent

19. It is also being alleged that certain members of the US congress which shapes ""defense"" policy & is lobbied heavily by the Israeli connected Jewish Lobby purchased the stocks of ""defense""  contractors before the latest Israel-Palestine conflict similar to the suspicious options trading before 9/11

20. The attacks conveniently happen at a time when the Ukraine war is all but lost, losing support and slowly fading from the press. Just like that a new war erupts. This is just as it always is. If we're talking about the 1900s and 2000s alone, a new, major conflict or enemy is always right around the corner. 1st it was Germany/the Triple Alliance. Then it's Nazi Germany/the Axis. Then it's the Soviets/Vietnam/North Korea and communism. Then it's ME terrorism via the Taliban & Al Qaeda. After Bin Laden is allegedly killed, the terror threat gets a makeover & all of a sudden its all about ISIS. Then COVID comes out of nowhere. Then the Ukraine war erupts. Now its Israel vs Hamas which could easily turn into a regional war involving Iran/US/NATO. 

What's next? A cyber pandemic? Disease X? A North Korean war? A war with China over Taiwan? A recession/depression? Solar flares? Aliens? Bringing back the global war on terror using Palestinians as an excuse? They could even launch a new 9/11 with the still missing 60,000 pounds of ammonium nitrate or the allegedly missing 800,000 tons of radioactive waste from Pennsylvania drilling. What about a nuclear third world war. Tactical nukes? Biological warfare? Perhaps climate change and a series of weather warfare/weather weaponry related attacks can occur using tectonic weapons, chem trials, earthquake bombs, weaponized lightning, laser/directed energy weapons, etc. The possibilities are endless. 

They want us anxious and on edge by employing Fifth Generation Warfare. Like a demon or monster in a horror movie, fear and hate are their number one weapons. It's how they grow in power. We must not let them win over our minds.

We must not let them use false flag after false flag to trick us over and over again into spreading more hate, violence and support for their endless wars.",Puzzlebrain21,t2_b5n15jrl,0.84,316,80

The Hamas attack was an inside job, now we are watching a genocide. I’m not even saying Hamas good Israel bad, Hamas would genocide Israel if they could. What I’m saying is Israel allowed the attack to happen, gunned down their own people during the attack alongside with Hamas by accident per say, and now are using this event which they allowed to happen so they can launch a full scale genocide which we can watch on our phones while eating popcorn. People just going about their day watching innocent people getting blown apart under the label of “war”. None of this is ever gunna change unless we acknowledge the deep state.  Israel allowed the Hamas hang glider attack (These homies deflect rockets but can’t deflect hang gliders? You don’t have to go to the Gaza border to know this is bullshit and everyone’s acting emotional like after 9/11 and not seeing the inside job aspects).

 Life is a lie it’s a one sided coin. Most of politics is theatre for those who can’t see beyond the veil of not just political leaders; but of the NHI/deep-state/illuminate/alien aspect of our existence. This is only relevant because these topics relate to perpetual war and perpetual conflict amongst the human species. I mean this in a sense that people in democratic countries go to the polls and cast votes that are absolutely meaningless when there is a cataclysmic amount of fuckery, corruption, and NHI behind the scenes when it comes to the truth of what really goes down on our planet. We pretend like life is this game of Climate Change, pandemic, war, famine, etc. we accept these phenomenon as natural when there is nothing natural about our lives or our media which is meticulously structured to provide specific agendas and keep the conversation within a certain narrative. Anything honest is not allowed to penetrate mainstream society and is kept out by the blockade parade. The whole issue comes down to the fact that there is a deep state shadow government which is involved in nefarious black budget projects which are intertwined with NHI. These programs involve infinite things; but some aspects of these programs involve human trafficking, spreading viruses, and starting wars. If we want wars to end, we need to dismantle the deep state and figure out beyond obvious financial gain why is war always the flavour of the month with deep state/shadow governments.

 How do I know NHI is real? I’ve seen 4 up close UFOs and 2 human shapeshifters. Where is my evidence for this and everything else I just stated? My evidence is Trust me bro, for I am you and you am I, and we both know this world is a lie.

My only point is that anyone who sits back and watches what Israel does funded by the US, EU, all the democratic homies are funding this genocide and the whole thing was a staged event set up by the one world government in order to create war and genocide. How many more innocent people have to die before the average person is brave enough to admit that they were wrong, conspiracy theory was a term created by the cia to discredit anyone brave enough dismantle the deepstate and acknowledge the NHI presence on our planet. All aspects of the phenomenon are pieces of a big puzzle which when you put the pieces together starts to answer a lot of major questions like:

1. Who really runs the world
2. That mother fuckers not real
3. Aliens or angels? Demons or reptiles?
4. Time travel, project looking glass
5. Ce5 - who am I contacting?
6. DUMBS- what are they used for?
7. Loosh? Prison planet?
8. Zero point energy/multiverse

All these aspects of our existence will become more clear when the deep states involvement with NHI becomes more clear and we as a species acknowledge that bombing each other and killing each other back and forth for all of time is really just another force entirely using us like puppets on a string. We are entering a point in history where we either descend into chaos and anarchy, under false illusions drawn up by secret societies like pandemics and climate change, and war/famine/genocide continues to rage on-we allow this to happen; or we create a revolution, dismantle the deepstate which uses us like cattle for their own nefarious agenda’s, and Learn the truth of our species’ involvement with NHI and try to create our own future. After seeing many fake events like 9/11 which was planned by OWG/deepstate, the fire in Hawaii which was a direct energy weapon attack, and now the Hamas attack which was allowed to happen by Israel and deepstate - I believe we as a species have no choice but to acknowledge these truths to be self evident and revolt against the secret societies which implement these events; or we will continually become victim to fake hoaxes such as climate change and plandemics; and pre-planed “wars” which in the case of Palestine is a genocide of innocent civilians. Unfortunately most of us are complete and utter cowards; we don’t even watch what happens in Palestine let alone contemplate how allowing this to happen here could result one day with bombs being dropped on us, no matter where we live. We are desensitized to the drastic nature of war and genocide. Because it has always happened, we assume it always will. It always will happen when the deepstate runs the world. When the deepstate is in charge, war is on the menu. The only issue with this is that it’s harder to disguise this conflict as war when it’s clearly a genocide; and it’s also harder for the deepstate to hide their false flag events.",JmoneyHimself,t2_4qckedio,0.72,298,203

Long but extremely informative and necessary to understand who runs the world, why Trump, Clintons, Biden are puppets, and why Putin and Zelensky are puppets of the Rothschild NWO Banking Cartel. Modern Ukraine formed in 1917 by Rothschilds","Amschel Moses Rothschild was born in about 1710. He was a German Jewish silk trader and money changer in the Judengasse (Jewstreet) in Frankfurt. Around 1743 he placed a red hexagram sign (which numerically and geometrically convert into the number 666) above the entrance of his door. His house was also red in color. 

Within two centuries, the Rothschild, instructed this hexagram sign to be made part of the Israeli flag 🇮🇱. He had 8 children with Schönche Lechnich, one of his sons, Mayer Amschel Rothschild (1744-1812), is the founder of the Rothschild banking dynasty. He marries Guttle Schnapper/Schönche Lechnich (Rothschild) in 1770, and they have 10 children together. 

Around 1760, Mayer Amschel Bauer worked for a bank owned by the Oppenheimer (are part of Rothschild family/married, had children together..). Mayer was very successful and became a junior partner, where he meets General von Estorff.

After Mayer Amschel Bauer’s father Moses Amschel Bauer died, Mayer changed his name from Bauer to Rothschild (Rot = red / Schild = sign).

Mayer Amschel Rothschild and his sons establish what was known as the Five Arrows of Banking. These golden arrows can be seen on the eagle’s talons visible on the coat of arms city from Frankfurt, Germany. It represented the 5 sons who managed the global banking Houses of the Rothschild which included:

• Frankfurt • London • Paris • Vienna • Napl 

Mayer discovers that General von Estorff is aquatinted with the court of Prince William IX, Landgrave of Hesse-Hanau (known today as Hesse-Kassel) (married?). The royal house of William obtained its’ wealth by the hiring out or exporting their soldiers to foreign countries for major profit. 

Mayer began selling William IX rare trinkets, treasures, and coins at extra low prices. Eventually, as planned, Mayer is introduced to the Prince himself, who is delighted with the modified prices. Mayer even offers the prince a perk for any new business opportunities, William could direct his way. As a result, Mayer Amschel Rothschild and Prince William join forces and become business accomplices. 

In 1769, Prince William grants Mayer approval to hang a sign on his business storefront declaring that he is, “M. A. Rothschild, by appointment court factor to his serene highness, Prince William of Hanau.” 

In 1773, Amschel Mayer Rothschild is born, eventually he would take over the Frankfurt bank. He is the first of Mayer’s sons who will all eventually enter the family business at 12 years of age. He is followed by Salomon Mayer Rothschild, in 1774.

In 1776, Mayer Amschel Rothschild creates the Illuminati and hands over the organizations development to Adam Weishaupt. Weishaupt sneaks in the Continental Order of Freemasons with this Illuminati doctrine. This doctrine claims a new order for the human race under the dictatorship of Satan and his supporters. This view is accepted and spread like a wildfire and is pursued in Masonic Lodges worldwide to this day.

In 1777, Nathan Mayer Rothschild is born, who is followed by Kalmann (Carl) Mayer Rothschild/Carl Mayer Freiherr von Rothschild in 1788. Carl is the founder of the Rothschild banking family of Naples. He had child named Adolf Carl....

In 1791, Alexander Hamilton, (a Rothschild representative in George Washington’s cabinet) and the Rothschilds, infiltrated a central bank in the newly established United States colonies. This bank was know as the Bank of the United States and was organized with a 20 year charter.

“Jacob” or “James” Mayer de Rothschild or Baron de Rothschild is born in 1792. Originally named Jakob Mayer Rothschild. He is the youngest child of Mayer. He was a German-French banker and is the founder of the French banking branch of the Rothschild family. He had 5 children. 

Amschel Mayer Rothschild marries Eva Hanau in 1796. 

In 1798, Mayer, grants his son, Nathan Mayer Rothschild, a major sum of money, and sends him to England, to advance the family interests in importing textile. This allowed him to establish a bank in the City of London known as N. M. Rothschild & Sons.

In 1806, Prince William, escapes Germany and assigns his $3,000,000 fortune over to Mayer Amschel Rothschild for guardianship, because Napoleon made it his objective to abolish the rulership and influence of the house of Hess-Cassel.

Nathan Mayer also marries Rothschild Hannah Barent Cohen during this time. 

In 1808, Nathan Mayer Rothschild has his first child, Lionel Nathan de Rothschild.

In 1810, Mayer entered into a formal partnership agreement with his three eldest sons. Abraham Goldsmid and Sir Francis Baring die, leaving Nathan Mayer Rothschild as the last major remaining banker in England.

Salomon Mayer Rothschild launches the bank, M. von Rothschild und Söhne in Vienna, Austria. And Calmann (""Carl"") established the branch in Naples, Italy.

The youngest son Jacob, was sent to Paris in 1811, strengthening the family's ability to operate across Europe by opening the bank “de Rothschild Frères. This allowed them to profit by funding the Wellington's armies in Portugal, which required them to secure large quantities of gold in favor of the British government.

The charter established between the Rothschild and the Bank of the United States in 1791 runs out in 1811 and Congress decided to vote against its renewal. 

Andrew Jackson (7th President of the U.S. from 1829 to 1837) stated, “If Congress has a right under the Constitution to issue paper money, it was given them to use by themselves, not to be delegated to individuals or corporations.”

Nathan Mayer Rothschild replied, “Either the application for renewal of the charter is granted, or the United States will find itself involved in a most disastrous war.” 

In 1812, Britain, which was supported by the Rothschild empire, declared war on the United States. The Rothschilds systematically arranged this war to cause the United States to build up a major debt due to them defending themselves. Eventually, they would have to surrender which forced them to renew the charter for the Rothschild owned Bank of the United States.

Mayer Amschel Rothschild perishes. In his will, he establishes very specific rules that the Rothschild must obey: 

• All major positions in the family business may only be held by family members; specifically only male members, which included a rumored sixth bastard son. (Mayer Amschel also had five daughters. Their Zionist empire also included mixed offspring of Jewish decent.) • In order to preserve their fortune they had to intermarry with their first and second cousins (16 of the 18 marriages between Mayers’ grandchildren were between first cousins). • No publication of their estates or inventory • no legal action was to be taken with respect to the value of their fortune • The oldest son of the oldest son was to become the head of the family, but this could be reversed if the bulk of the family decided otherwise. 

The $3,000,000 entrusted to Mayer by Prince William is accounted for in the Jewish Encyclopaedia, 1905 edition, Volume 10, page 494, which states, “According to legend this money was hidden away in wine casks, and, escaping the search of Napoleon’s soldiers when they entered Frankfurt, was restored intact in the same casks in 1814, when the elector (Prince William IX of Hesse-Hanau) returned to the electorate (Germany). The facts are somewhat less romantic, and more businesslike.”

The money was never truly “returned” by Rothschild to Prince William, instead their families married each other for business purposes, to keep the money hidden and allowing both families to gain and grow the empire. The encyclopaedia also states, “Nathan Mayer Rothschild invested this $3,000,000 in, gold from the East India Company knowing that it would be needed for Wellington’s peninsula campaign.” The Rothschilds made, “no less than four profits: 1. i) On the sale of Wellington’s paper which he bought at 50 cents on the dollar and collected at par; 2. ii) on the sale of gold to Wellington; 3. iii) on its repurchase; and 4. iv) on forwarding it to Portugal.”

In 1815, the Rothschild brothers started their policy of financing both sides of the wars by the suppling them with gold Wellington’s army (Nathan in England) and Napoleon’s army (Jacob in France).

Since these brothers had banks spread out across Europe, it allowed them to set up an unmatched postal service grid of secret routes and couriers allowing them to be one step ahead of the crowd.

These couriers were the only ones allowed to pass through the French and English blockades, which then reported back to Nathan and kept him up to date with how the war was going allowing him to buy/sell stock successfully. 

When the war ended and the British defeated Napoleon, Nathan, through past strategic planning made a return of 20:1 on his investments, which gave the Rothschilds complete control over the British economy forcing England to establish a different Bank of England, which Nathan controlled. He would later state, 

“I care not what puppet is placed upon the throne of England to rule the Empire on which the sun never sets. The man who controls Britain’s money supply controls the British Empire, and I control the British money supply.”

The newly established Bank of England controlled by the Rothschilds changed their approach of shipping gold to different countries by using their five banks across Europe to set up a banking system of paper credits and, which is still used today.

In 1816, the Rothschild’s charter for the Bank of the United States was renewed for twenty more years giving the Rothschilds full control of the American money supply once again. 

After the French’s defeat at Waterloo, the French attained major loans in 1817 to rebuild themselves. 

In 1818, the Rothschilds, bought large amounts of French government bonds allowing them to take control of the French money supply. They also loaned the Prussian government £5,000,000.

In the year 1821, Kalmann (Carl Mayer Rothschild), was sent to Naples, Italy. There he conducted many business deals with Pope Gregory XVI and the Vatican, eventually coming up with the Order of St. George.

By 1823, the Rothschild empire has gained complete financial control over the Catholic Church operations, globally.

In 1827, Sir Walter Scott, published a nine volume set book series. In volume two he writes that the French Revolution was prepared by Adam Weishaipt’s Illuminati and funded by the Rothschilds’ European banking empire.

In 1835, the 7th president of the United States, Andrew Jackson, began placing the federal funds into banks managed by democratic bankers instead of the Rothschild governed Bank of the United States.

This lead to an assassination attempt being made on President Jackson, who would later declare that he knew the Rothschilds were at fault for the assassination attempt.

The Rothschilds gained ownership over the Almadén quicksilver mines in Spain. This was important, because quicksilver was a critical factor in the refining of gold or silver. This established a basic world monopoly for the Rothschild banking empire.

Nathan Mayer Rothschild dies in 1836. and his bank, N. M. Rothschild & Sons is taken over by his younger brother, James Mayer Rothschild.

In the year 1837, President Andrew Jackson succeeds in overthrowing the Rothschild controlled Bank of America. It wouldn’t be until the year 1913 that the Rothschilds could reestablish their third central bank in America, the (illegal) Federal Reserve.

In 1838, Amschel Mayer Rothschild declares, “Permit me to issue and control the money of a nation, and I care not who makes its laws.”

In 1840, the Rothschilds become stock brokers of the Bank of England. This allows them to set up agencies in Australia and California. 

In 1844, Salomon Mayer Rothschild, buys the United Coal Mines of Vítkovice and a Hungarian Blast Furnace Company. 

Jacob (James) Mayer Rothschild/Baron James de Rothschild, married his niece, Betty, who is the daughter of his brother Salomon Mayer Rothschild. James wins a deal allowing him to assemble the first major railroad line called the Chemin De Fer Du Nord, which ran from Paris to Valenciennes. Eventually this railway would join together with the Austrian rail-system built by his brother Salomon Mayer Rothschild.

In 1858, Lionel De Rothschild takes his seat in the British parliament making him the first Jewish member. 

In 1861, the 16th President of the United States, Abraham Lincoln (1860-1865) secures loans through the Rothschilds to fund the American civil war via Charters, but these loans came at high interest rates (between 24% -36%).

So, Lincoln decided to print his own money, which was debt free and could be legally used in private and public debts/affairs. By April 1862, $449,338,902 of the debt free money Lincoln created was distributed.

In 1863, Italy, unifies causing the (Carl) Rothschild bank in Naples, Italy, to close. So the Rothschilds decided they would use their American assistant, John D. Rockefeller, to help establish an oil business also known as Standard Oil, who became the leader in the industry. 

Alexander II (1855 – 1881), Tsar of Russia, also had issues with the Rothschilds, because he refused to let them set up a central bank in Russia. In 1864, Abraham Lincoln discovers this feud and request Tsar to help fund the Civil War. Tsar agrees and sends part of his navy to the coast of New York and California. Allowing Lincoln to win the Civil War.

In 1865, President Lincoln states in a statement to Congress, “I have two great enemies, the Southern Army in front of me, and the financial institution in the rear. Of the two, the one in my rear is my greatest foe.”

President Lincoln is assassinated later that year (1865).

Otto von Bismarck states in 1876, “The division of the United States into two federations of equal force was decided long before the civil war by the high financial power of Europe.These bankers were afraid that the United States, if they remained in one block and as one nation, would attain economical and financial independence, which would upset their financial domination over the world. The voice of the Rothschilds predominated. They foresaw the tremendous booty if they could substitute two feeble democracies, indebted to the financiers, to the vigorous Republic, confident and self-providing. Therefore they started their emissaries in order to exploit the question of slavery and thus dig an abyss between the two parts of the Republic.”

The 20th President of the United States, James A. Garfield (lasted only 100 Days) stated two weeks before he was assassinated in 1881, “Whoever controls the volume of money in our country is absolute master of all industry and commerce…and when you realize that the entire system is very easily controlled, one way or another, by a few powerful men at the top, you will not have to be told how periods of inflation and depression originate.”

Edmond James de Rothschild has a son named Maurice de Rothschild. (Adolf Hitler is really Maurice de Rothschild with fake beard and hair piece and carries out his father’s (Baron Abraham Edmond Benjamin James de Rothschild 1845 –1934) work. Since the war caused a sugar shortage, Maurice would have also been the candy man aka Willy Wanka and his top hat 🎩 and cain in his photos match the part).

In 1886, The French Rothschild bank, de Rothschild Frères, gains the Russian oil fields and establishes the Caspian and Black Sea Petroleum Company, which eventually becomes second largest global oil producer.

The Rothschilds become the biggest shareholder of the De Beers company in 1887, which included mining valuable stones in India and Africa. They achieved this by financing the South Africa’s Kimberley diamond mines.

Maurice de Rothschild’s future wife, Noémie Halphen, is born in 1888.

Around 1891, the Rothschilds they purchased the Reuters news agency, to gain control of the media.

In 1895, Edmond James de Rothschild visits Palestine and begins helping fund the first Jewish colonies located there.

In 1897, The Rothschilds organize their first meeting with the Zionist Congress in Munich. However, this meeting was re-arranged to take place in Basle, Switzerland on Aug. 29th, due to Jewish resistance. This meeting is supervised by Theodor Herzl, who would declare in his diaries, “It is essential that the sufferings of Jews….become worse….this will assist in realization of our plans….I have an excellent idea….I shall induce anti-Semites to liquidate Jewish wealth….The anti-Semites will assist us thereby in that they will strengthen the persecution and oppression of Jews. The anti-Semites shall be our best friends.”

Herzl was elected to be the President of the Zionist Organization. The Zionist society adopted the Red Rothschild Hexagram Sign that Amschel Moses Rothschild placed on his house on Judengasse (Jewstreet), on their Zionist flag. This hexagram sign would end up on the flag of Israel 🇮🇱 51 years later.

The Rothschilds help fund Edward Henry Harriman. This allowed him to become the director of the Union Pacific Railroad which would eventually also gain control of the Southern Pacific Railroad.

In 1901 the Jewish colonies established by Edmond James de Rothschild in Palestine. They send him a delegation which states, “If you wish to save the Yishuv (The Jewish colonies) first take your hands from it, and…for once permit the colonists to have the possibility of correcting for themselves what needs correcting.”

Edmond James de Rothschild does not react very well to these news and states, “I created the Yishuv, I alone. Therefore no men, neither colonists nor organisations have the right to interfere in my plans.”

The M. A. von Rothschild und Söhne banking house in Frankfurt, Deutschland 🇩🇪, closes because there was no male Rothschild heir to take over the bank.

The Jewish Encyclopaedia (Vol. 2, p.497) states, “It is a somewhat curious sequel to the attempt to set up a Catholic competitor to the Rothschilds that at the present time the latter are the guardians of the papal treasure.”

In 1906, the Rothschilds insisted that the land was experiencing increased instability, while the Rockefellers were simultaneously￼ becoming a rising competition. This was a lie, because in reality, the Rockefellers were the offspring of the Rothschilds through a female lineage. They owned Standard Oil, which is why they sold their Caspian Black Sea and Caspian Petroleum to Shell and Royal Dutch.

John F. Hylan, then mayor of New York, states in 1911, “The real menace of our republic is the invisible government which, like a giant octopus, sprawls its slimy length over our city, state and nation. At the head is a small group of banking houses, generally referred to as international bankers.”

George R. Conroy talks about the Rothschild banker Jacob Schiff in the December 1912 issue of, “Truth,” magazine, and states, “Mr Schiff is head of the great private banking house of Kuhn, Loeb, and co, which represents the Rothschilds interests on this side of the Atlantic. He has been described as financial strategist and has been for years the financial minister of the great impersonal power known as Standard Oil. He was hand in glove with the Harrimans, the Goulds, and the Rockefellers in all their railroad enterprises and has become the dominant power in the railroad and financial power of America.”

The Anti Defamation League (ADL) is established in the United States by the Rothschilds in 1913, which labeled anyone who challenged the Global Elite as “anti-Semitic.” This is also the year that they founded their last central bank which still exists today, the Federal Reserve. 

After the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 was passed/singed into law on December 23, by the 28th President of the United States, Woodrow Wilson, which created the Federal Reserve Banking System, Congressman Charles Lindbergh, stated, “The Act establishes the most gigantic trust on earth. When the President signs this Bill, the invisible government of the monetary power will be legalized…….The greatest crime of the ages is perpetrated by this banking and currency bill.”

**The Federal Reserve System is a private Organization also known as a charity and is Illegal!!! They also do not publish their accounts**\*

By the year 1914 the Rothschilds have gained control of multiple European media agencies, which included, Havas (est. 1835) in France, Wolff (est. 1849) in Germany, and Reuters (est. 1851) in England. Wolff News company was used to systematically shape German individuals into believing war the way to go. Since the Rothschilds owned the media now, they were seldomly reported on.

Since, Tsar Alexander II choose to side with President Lincoln in the Cvil War in 1864, he and his whole family in Russia were executed in 1917 by an order of the Rothschilds. They kill the entire family to show the world what happens when you try to cross them. 

In 1919, Baron Edmond de Rothschild, the boss, hosted the Versailles peace convention, which meets after the end of World War I to determine what must be repaid by the Germans to the victors. In this conference, it is also officially declared that Israel would be considered a Jewish homeland. Control of Palestine was handed to Britain, which the Rothschilds ruled.

The Times of London report on March 29th on the Bolsheviks in Russia stating, “One of the curious features of the Bolshevist movement is the high percentage of non Russian elements among its leaders. Of the twenty or thirty commissaries, or leaders, who provide the central machinery of the Bolshevist movement, not less than 75% were Jews.”

The Rothschilds were not happy with the Russians because they did not want them to establish their own central bank within their community. So they hired Jewish agents to spy on Russia and plant seeds in the heads of the Russian community about a revolution that would assist the common man by promoting rebellion through riots. The Rothschilds strategically set this up to conquer￼ Russia, so they could establish their own bank there.

The International Edition of the Jewish Post (January 1991)verifies that Vladimir Lenin was Jewish and was caught on record declaring, “The establishment of a central bank is 90% of communizing a nation.”

These Jewish Bolsheviks, funded by the Rothschild would end up would end up slaughtering 60 million Non-Jews and Christians in a Soviet controlled region.

Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, an author, confirms in his writings, “Gulag Archipelago, Vol 2,” that the Zionist Jews planned and executed the Soviet concentration camp structure. Where millions of Non-Jews and Christians died. On page 79 of his book he mentions the names of the leaders who were behind these camps. This included the Zionist Jews, Yakov Rappoport, Aron Solts, Naftaly Frenkel, Lazar Kogan, Genrikh Yagoda, and Matvei Berman. 

The role of adjusting the daily global gold prices is permanently handed over to M. Rothschild & Sons’. Every day around 1100 hours this change took place in the City of London offices, in the same room, until 2004.

N. M. Rothschild & Sons banking house invests in the Underground Electric Railways Company of London Ltd in 1926 giving them total control of the London railway transport system.

Maurice de Rothschild son, Edmond de Rothschild is also born in 1926.

By 1933, the Rothschilds controlled the supply machines of IBM, which produced punch cards (used to input data into the first computers), which allowed the Nazis to organize and identify the Jewish individuals and kept track of their confiscated property and eventual extermination.

The Swiss bank secrecy laws are altered in 1934, making it a violation for any bank employee to breach the bank secrecy. This was arranged by the Rothschilds to prepare for World War II, where again, they would back both sides.

The Austrian bank in Vienna, S. M. von Rothschild und Söhne, closed in 1938 after the Nazi settlement of Austria.

The biggest producer of steel Germany and preeminent manufacturer of chemicals for the world was a company called, I.G. Farben, who in 1939, suddenly ramped up its production in order to equip Germany for World War II. The Rothschilds controlled I.G. Farben, who also produced the Zyklon B gas used to exterminate the Jewish population. The Rothschilds also used the Jews and other people in the concentration camps for slave labor. 

World War II begins in 1939.

The book, “Inside The Gestapo,” written by Hansjurgen Koehler in 1940, mentions Adolf Hitler’s grandmother, Maria Anna Schicklgruber, and states, “A little servant girl…….came to Vienna and became a domestic servant…….at the Rothschild mansion…….and Hitler’s unknown grandfather must be probably looked for in this magnificent house.”

In Walter Langer book, “The Mind Of Hitler,” he supports this statement by writing, “Adolf’s father, Alois Hitler, was the illegitimate son of Maria Anna Schicklgruber…….Maria Anna Schicklgruber was living in Vienna at the time she conceived. At that time she was employed as a servant in the home of Baron Rothschild. As soon as the family discovered her pregnancy she was sent back home…….where Alois was born.”

Prescott Bush was the father of George Herbert Walker Bush and the grandfather of George W. Bush, both future presidents. He helped finance Hitler from America. Due to his funding, his organization was seized in the, “Trading With The Enemy Act of 1942.”

World War II ends in 1945. It is also noted that the I.G. Farben companies only sustained 15% damage, concluding that they were not a target in the bombing of Germany. Any information connecting Western aid to Hitler is censored through the Nazi War Crimes investigation held at the end of World War II by the tribunals. 

In Spring of 1948, the 33rd President of the United States Harry S. Truman (1945 – 1953) is bribed with $2,000,000 by the Rothschilds to acknowledge Israel (Rothschild owned) as a Jewish sovereign state in Palestine. The United States is the first nation to recognize it and the new flag is soon revealed. The new Israel flag depicted a blue hexagram on it, which was exactly like the red Rothschild hexagram, found on Amschel Moses Rothschild’s doorstep. 

The Jewish knew the hexagram represented the “Moloch,” which was the biblical name of a Canaanite god relating to child sacrifice, by means of fire or war. The stone owl located at the Bohemian Grove worshipped by the elite is also named Moloch and Astaroth (Lord Treasurer of Hell). The hexagram also symbolized Saturn, which has been identified as the mystical name for “Satan.” This would mean that anyone murdered in the name of Israel was in reality an offering to Satan.

In 1953, the British Newfoundland Corporation Ltd was founded by N. M. Rothschild & Sons of London. They build a power plant to harness the electricity of the Hamilton (renamed Churchill) Falls (waterfall) on 60,000 square miles of terrain in Newfoundland, Canada.

Edmond de Rothschild established Compagnie Financiere, Paris, in 1955.

In the year 1962, the French banking house, de Rothschild Frères, founded Imétal, a shade company for all their mineral excavating shares.

A book called, “The Rothschilds”, written by Frederic Morton writes, “Though they control scores of industrial, commercial, mining and tourist corporations, not one bears the name Rothschild. Being private partnerships, the family houses never need to, and never do, publish a single public balance sheet, or any other report of their financial condition.”

This statement showcases the true mission of the Rothschilds.  
 It was their objective to eradicate all competition and establish their own global monopoly.

On July 4th 1962, the 35th President of the United States, John F. Kennedy, held a speech at Independence Hall, in which he mocked the Declaration of Independence and states that the Constitution, “stressed not Independence but Interdependence.” 

On June 4th 1963, the 35th President of the United States, John F. Kennedy, issues the Executive Order 11110, which returned the power to distribute currency back to the U.S. government, without having to go through the Federal Reserve possessed by the Rothschilds.

On November 22nd 1963, Kennedy was shot by the Rothschilds. Kennedy’s motive was to distribute and print American currency for the American people. Abraham Lincoln was assassinated for the same reason in 1865 by the Rothschilds. 

The 37th President of the United States, Lyndon Baines Johnson, declares the Executive Order 11110 as void, the same day that Kennedy was killed.

La Compagnie Financière Edmond de Rothschild (LCF), in Switzerland, an investment bank with many associates is established by Edmond de Rothschild. Today, this bank is known as the Swiss Bank. Edmond marries Nadine and have a son together named, Benjamin de Rothschild.

In 1973, Gary Allen, wrote a book called, None Dare Call It Conspiracy, which states, “One major reason for the historical blackout on the role of the international bankers in political history is the Rothschilds were Jewish… ….The Jewish members of the conspiracy have used an organisation called The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) as an instrument to try and convince everyone that any mention of the Rothschilds and their allies is an attack on all Jews. In this way they have stifled almost all honest scholarship on international bankers and made the subject taboo within universities. Any individual or book exploring this subject is immediately attacked by hundreds of ADL communities all over the country. The ADL has never let the truth or logic interfere with its highly professional smear jobs… ….Actually, nobody has a right to be more angry at the Rothschild clique than their fellow Jews… ….The Rothschild empire helped finance Adolf Hitler.”

IBM was controlled by the Rothschilds through their employee, George J. Laurer. IBM creates the UPC (Universal Product Code) barcode, which is placed upon every product traded worldwide. IBM’s UPC barcode bears the mark of the beast, 666. Everything bought or sold is therefore the mark of the beast.

The Book of Revelation 13:17 says, “No man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.”

The Churchill Falls power plant in Newfoundland, Canada, is finished. N. M. Rothschild & Sons of London, adds an asset management company, called the Rothschild Private Management Limited, which traded globally. Today this company is know as Rothschild & Co.

In 1980, global privatization starts due to the Rothschilds plan to eventually seize power of all publicly held assets.

In 1981, a new bank called, Compagnie Européenne de Banque is established in France. The successor to this bank is Rothschild & Cie Banque (RCB), which eventually becomes a leading French investment company.

Eustace Mullins writes in 1985, “Who Owns The TV Networks,“ where he discloses that the Rothschilds control of the three dominant U.S. Networks at the time: NBC; CBS; and ABC.

Edmond de Rothschild sets up the World Conservation Bank in 1987, which transferred debts from third world countries into his bank. This allowed the Rothschilds to gain land as a return from these countries. The Rothschilds systematically designed this system to gain control of the third world countries, which were about 30% of the land on Earth.

The French and British Rothschilds declare in 1989, the launch of a new branch called, Rothschild GmbH, located in Frankfurt, Germany.

Former Federal Reserve Board Chairman, Paul A. Volker becomes the new Chairman of the banking firm, J. Rothschild, Wolfensohn and Co. in Europe in March 1992.

In 1995, Dr Kitty Little, a past atomic energy scientist, stated that the Rothschilds now possessed 80% of the uranium supplies globally, creating their nuclear power monopoly.

The European Central Bank is established in 1998 and is located in Frankfurt, Germany.

George W. Bush, becomes the 43rd President of the United States in the year 2000. Bush and his family declare they are the ancestors of the House of Plantagenet, whose linage stems from the Royal House of Judah.

The September 11th attack of the Twin Towers was arranged by the United States, Britain, and Israel, through an order received from the Rothschilds. It was their goal to gain security and control over the world, while simultaneously eliminating the liberty of people globally. The Rothschild’s terrorist attack allowed them to gain power over nations who refused to build a central Rothschild bank. One of these 7 nations was Afghanistan, (at the time a nation without R. Bank, but 9/11 changed this.)

They also will use the attacks to gain control of the few nations in the world who don’t allow Rothschild central banks and so less than one month after these attacks, US forces attack Afghanistan, one of only 7 nations in the world who don’t have a Rothschild controlled central bank.

A week before the twin tower attack, the Zim Shipping Company, located in the World Trade Centers, break their lease and leave behind their work station. No explanation has been given, but it is know that the Zim Shipping Company is half owned by the State of Israel, which is owned by The Rothschilds.

In the year 2003, Iraq (Ancient Babylon), is one of the last six nations left that who don’t have a central bank owned by the Rothschilds. The war in Iraq was mostly about robbing their water sources for Israel. Israel has always struggled for water. Water is rare in Israel, so to them water is far more valuable than the oil reserves, which happen to be the second largest oil reserves on the globe. 

In 2006, the Edmond De Rothschild Banque a secondary branch of the Edmond De Rothschild bank in France, is the first foreign bank to acquire authorization of the China to enter China’s economic market.",icky_vicinity23,t2_q75jxnp8,0.78,167,69

Referring to them as ""human animals"" and labelling them all as terrorists.   Its disgusting the amount of comments I've read, of people actively encouraging mass genocide.  Israel have certainly found a ""final solution"" for the Palestinians.  Oh the irony. I could laugh if it wasn't so tragic.  It's absolutely  abhorrent, what's happening. 

The amount of utter bullshit propaganda and downright LIES in the media.  It's no wonder people are out with their pitchforks, baying for blood. It's not the peoples' fault they're so easily led. Actually it is, but anyway. Example :  the media say there were 40 beheaded babies and the news travelled to millions of people.  It then transpired that this was false information and there was no evidence.  The journalist apologised. 
Too late though, people believe it now.  They won't listen to reason and get worked.up into a frenzy, they stop thinking rationally.  They just  want revenge, and if hundreds of thousands of children are collateral damage, then, oh well.  They were terrorists anyway. It was worth it. 

WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO HUMANITY?!!

Joseph Goebbels, the nazi propaganda minister said "" If you tell a big enough lie, and keep repeating it, people will eventually come to believe it."" That's what's happening here.

I also want to add that I've seen that Israel is giving the citizens of Gaza time to move to the south before they begin the annihilating, but I've also seen a video of a girl in Palestine saying that on route to the ""safe place"" Israel dropped bombs, killing many. 

It was, of course, disgusting, what Hamas did and the news was very traumatic.  THEY are the terrorists. Hamas.  NOT the innocent civilians.  How can anyone justify annihilating  over a million innocent people? People, who,  as I write this have no access to water, fuel or  electricity, and they've also just cut off their internet access.   Cut off from the rest of the world. At least 50% of Palestinians are children.  CHILDREN!   I don't give a damn about ""hamas need to be stopped"".  Yes they do, of course need to be stopped if they""re killing innocent civilians .  But this is not the way! Killing children! We may be about to witness a genocide of sadly, mostly children.  This is being promoted.  

I really hope and pray that there's a light at the end of this.  But for now, all I can do is pray for the Palestinians and think of them sitting in the dark, waiting to die. It's a bloody joke, Humanity has failed.",somewot_anonymous,t2_kayvl4f4,0.8,164,80

It just so happens that the U.S. is now proposing an international coalition of western governments to preside over Gaza once Israel pushes its 2 million inhabitants into Egypt. There's similar plans underway for the West Bank. Since the war started, Israel has already awarded a dozen gas exploration licenses to six different oil companies, including BP.

&#x200B;

If what Hamas did on Oct 7, 2023 to Israel is terrorism so is what Israel has been doing not only since Oct 7, 2023 but since 1947 to Palestine.

&#x200B;

How convenient that the official definition of terrorism excludes state actions. 

&#x200B;

Here is an updated list of terroristic atrocities committed by Israel upon Gaza since Oct 7, 2023- 

&#x200B;

1. Israel has used the banned White Phosperous upon both Lebanon and Gaza 

2. Israel has dropped well over 6,000+ bombs upon Gaza in probably the most relentless and devastating bombing campaign unleashed by Israel upon Gaza to date & that's saying something considering how many times Gaza has been pummeled by Israel over the years

3. Israel directed 1.1+ million Gazans to flee Northern Gaza for Southern Gaza in a matter of 24 hours. This is forced displacement and it is quite impossible to achieve in such little time. Furthermore, Gaza is a really densely packed enclave with 2.3 million ppl of which 50% are children packed into just 141 sq m

4. So far 1+ million Gazans have been displaced in only 10 days of fighting

5. So far Israeli bombardment has killed 3,450+ Gazans & wounded 13,000+ Gazans

6. Israel's military, police & settlers have killed 60+ Palestinians in the West Bank & injured a further 300+

7. After forcing many in Northern Gaza to flee to Southern Gaza, they lit up the fleeing convoys of civilians killing 70+ in just that attack alone

8. Also, after issuing a directive to clear Northern Gaza of civilians they have increased bombardment of Southern Gaza which was supposed to be a refuge for fleeing civilians 

9. They bombed a hospital in Gaza killing hundreds of Palestinians in that attack alone. Casualty estimates are as high as 500+. This is the deadliest airstrike carried out by Israel in all of its wars since 2008. As usual, they proceeded to blame Palestine for this.

10. Israeli airstrikes in Lebanon killed a Reuters journalist and wounded Al Jazeera journalists

11. Israel also bombed a hospital killing a Doctor's Without Borders (MSF) aid worker

12. In addition to bombing hospitals and killing journalists, Israel has bombed refugee camps, mosques, apartment buildings, etc 

13. Israel enacted a total siege upon Gaza in which case electricity, internet, fuel, water, medicine, food, etc are not allowed. This is a human rights violation and a violation of international law. It is tantamount to mass starvation by using starvation as a weapon which is exactly what Hitler did. It is also an example of collective punishment

14. When aid workers were attempting to deliver much needed supplies to Gaza via the Rafah Border Crossing with Egypt, the only crossing that Israel doesn't control in Southern Gaza, they bombed that area on multiple occasions in order to prevent supplies from coming in

15. Israel, on more than one occasion, has bombed both Aleppo & Damascus International Airports in Syria. Bombing airports is what terrorists do

16. A UN-operated school housing thousands of war displaced was also hit with at least 6+ people killed in Gaza

17. 12 Palestinians were killed in an Israeli air raid in Khan Younis refugee camp 

18. There have been over 115 attacks on healthcare in Palestine since the start of the conflict on October 7, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). At least 20 hospitals in Gaza City and North Gaza and one hospital in Rafah have received repeated evacuation orders from the Israeli military, and 77 attacks have been documented in the West Bank, 43 of these attacks have caused physical violence to health teams.

43,17hbzfk,2023-10-27,conspiracy,Denying Palestinian Suffering,"Israeli apologists and strong supporters of Israel like US politicians are suddenly questioning the official stats released by the Gaza Health Ministry

They are suggesting that the Hamas linked ministry cannot be trusted and that they are most likely inflating the stats pertaining to the number of dead/injured in Gaza

I wish this was true

Biden even publically made such remarks which is outright disgusting. It is essentially his pro Israeli stance and only that. He has no evidence of this happening. He is merely pushing anti Palestinian, pro Israeli propaganda to shift the narrative in favour of an ally

Not only are the people of Gaza suffering, now even the mere existence of said suffering is being denied/questioned. They are being cancelled and tossed in the trash even in death as if they don't exist, as if they're suffering doesn't matter because according to Israeli apologists, it isn't even happening

If this isn't one of the most inhumane, anti Palestinian remarks, a sitting US president can make, I don't know what is

These are the same ppl condemning holocaust denial. Now, they themselves are denying the existence of the massacre of the people of Gaza just because the party being accused is their country or their ally

Of course it is obvious that due to the fog of war and politics, stats are inflated or reduced as a part of one's propagandistic narrative control in order to shape the views and opinions of the masses. A lot of the time it is difficult to independently verify war data. That goes without saying for any war

However, Israel is also denying foreign journalists from entering Gaza and has cut off internet access to Gaza probably to keep the outside world in the dark as much as possible about the true level of atrocities they are committing. Despite this, info is still getting out. This is why denying said atrocities is now a newly employed tactic to sow doubt in the minds of the masses

If you look at the reoccurring pattern of over responding on the part of Israel, stats from past Israeli aggression, the continuing pattern of lopsided death tolls when comparing Israeli casualties with that of Palestine, Israel's habitual terroristic actions in Gaza that tend to be indiscriminate and wide reaching, it isn't surprising that the death toll is so high in Gaza

Plus, the fact that Gaza is one of the most densely packed places on planet earth with 2.3 million people packed like sardines into just 141 sq m and the fact that this particular military campaign by Israel is the most unprecedented, wide spread, intense and largest EVER, the high death toll starts to make sense

Israel has dropped an est. 12,000+ tons of bombs on Gaza in just two weeks. No wonder the death toll is so high

What Israeli apologists don't seem to realize is that said denial is coming from pro Israeli sources. They are so quick to deny the credibility of anti Israeli sources, yet cannot seem to do the same for pro Israeli sources

Earlier on in the conflict, stories began circulating of burned/be-headed babies during the Hamas onslaught. This info spread quickly and was far reaching. Yet later on, even Israel and the US admitted that they couldn't verify the authenticity of said info. However, at that point, it didn't matter, as said atrocity propaganda had reached millions upon millions

If that's how they want it to be, one can easily say to said Israeli apologists that the info released by the Israeli gov pertaining to the casualty figures/brutality of the Hamas attack are inflated/overstated if we are to use the same ""logic"" as the Israeli apologists. If we should not support data released by Hamas, why should we believe data released by the IDF? Yet they won't think like this. They'll question data released by Gaza and blindly nod to data released by Israel or its allies like the US

In actuality, lying about said data to make the suffering appear worse will not result in a ""positive"" outcome for Gaza because even after more than two weeks of relentless bombing not to mention years upon years of said onslaught, nothing has been done to stop said bombing/years of Palestinian suffering. Western powers are still ""standing with Israel"". They are still providing military aid to Israel. There is no UN mandated intervention against Israel like we saw during the Korean War. There are no sanctions or embargoes or diplomatic ties being cut. Even UN resolutions calling for humanitarian pauses or a ceasefire are being ignored/voted against. Regardless of the casualty numbers, Israel continues to do what it wants

Furthermore, Human Rights Watch and the UN have supported data released by the Gaza Health Ministry indicating that the data tends to match with their own

Several foreign/international aid/medical agencies/services also operate in Gaza on the ground, in person from the Red Cross to the UNRWA to MSF to ANERA, etc. They have been getting patients daily and compiling data as well

The Gaza health ministry also released a very long list of names of the Gazans who have perished in Israel's most recent bombing campaign along with their gov ID

So far, between Oct 7, 2023 & Oct 26, 2023, 7,000+ have been killed in Gaza, a further 18,000+ have been injured in Gaza, 100+ have been killed in the West Bank and an est. 1,800+ have been injured in the West Bank. Plus, over 1.4 million Gazans have been displaced. These are terrifying numbers. Rather than being inflated, they are most likely not painting the full picture as there are still many underneath the rubble",Puzzlebrain21,t2_b5n15jrl,0.66,132,292
44,17nah11,2023-11-04,conspiracy,Why don’t people think the Hamas attack was a inside job by America and IDF,"Ever since 2001 America has used the excuse of terrorism to invade Middle Eastern countries and rid them of their natural resources. Completely set back Middle Eastern countries so they don’t get out of hand. Remember America doesn’t like when people get in their way.  Now yall probably think I am throwing a ton of accusations in here for no reason now let me explain why I think all of this is true. Get ready to be educated and disclaimer, I condemn all these terrorist acts and they are all acts of evil but let’s know why they did them in the first place. 

Let’s start with 9/11 as we know Osama bin Laden and Al-Qaeda orchestrated 9/11. Mainstream media likes to tell you that it’s just because they are Islamic extremist which is true but they are leaving out a lot of the story.  In the years before 9/11 Osama bin Laden was very very unhappy of America’s presence in Saudi Arabia and how America was essentially taking advantage of Saudi Arabia for their oil. So Osama bin Laden came up with a master plan of 9/11 which USA Intelligence, completely ignored all signs of and actively let it happen. PS a day before $2 trillion disappeared from the Pentagon, and one of the planes hit the very part of the pentagon responsible for this. The advantages America now has in their eyes far outweigh the damages of 9/11. So they used that excuse to destroy Middle Eastern nations set them back years, steal all their natural resources for Proffit and killed hundreds of thousands citizens. 




Now to modern day Israel ever since 1948 when the UN created Israel and gave land to the Jews along with Palestinians there. This was in wake of WW2 and the mass persecution of Jews/holocaust where millions of Jews died in horrific killings in the gas chambers. So I guess you can say their was special privilege  given to the Jews and Israel but out of this grew a aggressive type of movement called zionism and over the next 70+ years these Zionists have took almost of all of the land way from the Palestinians and have displaced millions and killed tens of thousands of citizens in the process. Hamas was formed as a radical Islamic group, because of the extremism from Israel. Hamas wanted death to all Jews which of course is wrong. But extremism breeds extremism. Moving to modern day….. days before the attack on October 7 Egyptian intelligence warned Israel of an attack which the IDF Completely ignored and an attack happened a horrible attack with loss of civilian life. But now the IDF have a perfect excuse to invade and kill everyone in their way, and retake the Gaza Strip and displace more Palestinians….. let’s not forget who Hamas is funded by Iran and now America will use the Israel and Hamas war  as a excuse to get Iran to attack Israel so America can come in and cripple Iran including the civilians And take another massive power grip in the Middle East and Proffit off of it.


The American military defense industry and the corporations above everyone are destroying the world for more and more and more money. America shouldn’t even be involved in these wars and conflicts. America will use these attacks by bad groups to justify it, and they are getting away with it. I pray for peace in the Middle East. I pray for Israel and Palestine.

The declaration was  contained in a letter from the United Kingdom’s Foreign Secretary [Arthur Balfour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Balfour) to [Lord Rothschild](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Rothschild,_2nd_Baron_Rothschild), a leader of the British Jewish community, for transmission to the Zionist Federation of Great Britain and Ireland.

In the following years, France, Italy and  the USA declared their agreement with the Declaration; at the San Remo  conference, the Balfour Declaration was approved by the Allies as the  basis for the post-war settlement in Palestine, and then it was included  in the text of the [British mandate for the administration of Palestine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandate_for_Palestine),  approved by the League of Nations. After the end of the Second World  War, when the League of Nations was replaced by the United Nations  Organisation, its charter introduced an article on the preservation in  force of all League of Nations mandates, a principle confirmed by the  Hague International Court of Justice. Thus, the “Balfour Declaration”  continued in force even after the formation of the UN, becoming the  official beginning of the process of establishing the State of Israel in  Palestine.

The adoption of the declaration led to a significant increase in Jewish immigration. [Over the next few years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Aliyah),  several tens of thousands of Jewish immigrants arrived in Palestine. As  a result, riots broke out in Jerusalem and Arabs intervened in clashes  between Jewish Communists and Zionists [during May demonstrations in Jaffa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaffa_riots).  The riots spread to other parts of the country, killing dozens of Jews  and Arabs and injuring hundreds. These events exposed the sharp  contradictions generated by the Balfour Declaration, which promised the  creation of a “national hearth” for the Jewish people without “violating  the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in  Palestine.”

Before  the adoption of the Declaration, Zionists considered various options  for the localisation of the future Israel, among which Palestine was  only one of the options, which as a result was actively supported by the  [revisionist Zionists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revisionist_Zionism), based on the ideas of [Vladimir Jabotinsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ze%27ev_Jabotinsky). There were American projects, such as the one [voiced by Theodor Herzl in his book “Der Judenstaat”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Der_Judenstaat) about an independent [Jewish state in Argentina](https://www.redressonline.com/2014/05/the-israel-that-could-have-been-in-argentina/), or the slogans “[America is our Zion](https://www.theatlantic.com/past/docs/unbound/bookauth/zionism/america.htm)” and “[America is our Promised Land](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/american-zionism)”  voiced at the Congress of the American Jewish Committee; there were  also a number of projects in the Old World, such as the creation of a [Jewish homeland in the Crimea](https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/news/articles/crimea-as-jewish-homeland).  The Balfour Declaration finally secured the priority for a future  Jewish state for the territory of Palestine for Zionists all over the  world.

Most of the Jewish emigration to Palestine was made up of natives of the Russian Empire (from the so-called “[Pale of Settlement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pale_of_Settlement)“) and [Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliyah_Bet).  In this aspect, it is worth noting that the State of Israel was founded  shortly after the end of World War II, and immediately after the  signing of the Balfour Declaration, exactly 5 days later, the [Great October Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_Revolution)  took place in Russia, establishing Soviet rule. The Declaration was  published in the same issue of the Times newspaper that reported on the  Russian Revolution.

The modern version of the religious writings of Judaism, on which the  current ideas about the ancient history of Judea and Israel are based,  was discovered less than 200 years ago in Odessa or Crimea by the  Karaite [Abraham Firkovich, who was repeatedly accused of forgeries during his lifetime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Firkovich#Forgery_Accusations). This so-called “[Leningrad Codex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leningrad_Codex)”  is the oldest fully preserved manuscript of the Tanakh, from which the  Christian versions of the Old Testament have been translated, and from  which most modern Jews pray. There are Judeo-Christian texts found even  before Firkovic’s discovery, but they are scrappy and often contradict  the modern version of the text, and [this is also true of the New Testament texts](https://zlaxyi.wordpress.com/2023/05/31/3114/).  Some scholars are revising the modern Judeo-Christian version of  history, noting that perhaps ancient Judea and Jerusalem were not  located in modern Palestine at all. Thus, for example, a number of  ancient images and texts have been discovered, testifying that about  300-400 years ago [Europeans called the ancient capital of Siam the Judea](https://sibved.livejournal.com/314399.html), and some researchers localise ancient Jerusalem on the Bosphorus in Anatolia, on the site of ancient [Hierapolis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierapolis) or [Constantinople itself](https://chronologia.org/en/chronologia7/chron7-pp1-5.pdf).",zlaxy,t2_1lmwj7tm,0.87,111,10

We saw this after the terrorism chapter got a makeover with ISIS.

In both cases, there were terrorist attacks throughout the world from the US to New Zealand to France to Spain to Sri Lanka.

They're trying to bring this back aka they are once again employing 4th Generation Warfare of which terrorism is a key component. 

At the same time, they also deploy 5th Generation Warfare which is meant to hack us psychologically using fear, hate, etc.

It's fascinating how terrorism vanished after they stopped obsessing about it and started obsessing about COVID/Ukraine.

Now all of a sudden the terrorism card is back in play once again just as the COVID & Ukraine obsession is diminishing.

They switch through their fearmongering campaigns like channels on TV.

They tune in and out and obsess over what they want us to focus upon. In other words, they direct our focus/attention. 
They tune into what they want us to be afraid of, not aware of. 

Since Oct 1, 2023, there has been a surge of attacks targeting Israel, Afghanistan, Turkey, Syria, the US, Belgium & France which have all witnessed attacks, at least some of which could be false flag attacks with potentially more on the way in different parts of the world. 

The perfect excuse now will obviously be the Israel-Palestine conflict which suddenly emerged just as coverage of & support for the Ukraine conflict was dialing down. 

However, at least some of the recent attacks were allegedly carried out by ISIS. Where was ISIS all this time? Were they hibernating? 

This is just another of the many scaremongering tactics to keep us in fear, anxious, nervous, on edge and filled with hate. 

There has been a large amount of pro-Palestinian protests all around the world because of the atrocities being committed by Israel in Gaza right now. Therefore, a sudden surge of ""Islamic/Muslim/Arab"" attackers can be a way to direct sympathy away from Palestine. 

Also, I don't know if there is anything to this but I find it strange that two Swedes (Swedan is trying to join NATO) are shot dead in Brussels (NATO HQ).

55,172bzon,2023-10-07,conspiracy,Israeli-Hamas Conspiracy,"BY WAY OF DECEPTION, THOU SHALT DO WAR

I thought this would happen months ago but I guess the May 2023 offensive btw the two sides didn't have the neccessary kick that was required. 

There is no way that Israeli intel (Shin Bet/Mossad, etc), one of the best intelligence forces in the world, especially on the 50th anniversary of the suprise Egyptian/Syrian attack upon Israel known as the Yom Kippur War, didn't know this was coming. Gaza/Hamas is under constant surveillance and Israeli double agents are everywhere. How could they miss 1,500+ fighters, vehicles and thousands of rockets? Are we expected to believe that Israel knew nothing about a mock Israeli settlement that was built/used by Hamas as an exercise to train for the attack. Are we also expected to believe that Hamas moved a ton of heavy equipment/vehicles to the border with Israel seeing none of these movements? This is what we may call low hanging fruit. 

Important Questions- 

1. Why was the Israeli response to the initial attack/infiltration so muted? 

2. How were Hamas operatives able to freely operate throughout Southern Israel with ease? 

3. Where was the Israeli military/advanced tech when Hamas was infiltrating Israel's border fence? 

4. Why is it that Palestinian rockets that weren't effective before are actually causing damage this time around?

5. According to Egyptian intel, Israel
ignored multiple warnings of ""something big"". Why did the usually security conscious Israel ignore such intel? This is what seems to happen before every false flag unfolds and it gives credence to the theory that they let this happen. 

6. Why was there such a large party for peace going on near the border with Gaza all night without proper security?

Israel's version of a mass casualty event like Pearl Harbour = false flag/manufactured crisis to spring forth a manufactured solution- 
 
There has been an est. 1,200+ Israeli deaths & 3,400+ injured
Israelis making this the largest/deadliest single attack upon Israel by Palestine outside of a war. In less than a day they suffered more casualties than they did in full fledged wars with Gaza. 

I believe that the Oct 2023 ""suprise"" attack achieves the following-

1. More money for the military industrial complex + for the politicians including members of the US congress and other top investors of ""defense"" contractors + big oil + big banks + big pharma, etc

2. More power under the declaration of war/a nationwide emergency for the Israeli gov/military/police/intel

3. A perfect excuse to shutdown protests that have been raging for 9+ months 

4. National unity in Israel which is deeply divided due to judicial reform. Reservists won't rebel, the Israeli gov coalition won't splinter or it can be reorganized more favourably, etc. Israel's opposition leader, Yair Lapid, actually proposed an emergency unity government. Netanyahu invites this and Gantz is involved as well. 

5. A perfect excuse to launch the biggest, multi week/month war/regime change op upon Gaza ever. They may try to take control of the Gaza Strip & overthrow the Hamas led gov there. My prediction is that there will be a massive air and ground invasion possibly resulting in 10k or more Palestinian injuries/deaths. I would say that this would be Israel's best excuse to get as close to wiping out Hamas as possible but the military industrial complex wants the threat of Hamas hanging around to ensure perpetual profit as do the Israelis for perpetual ""aid"" but I guess they still have Hezbollah, Iran, Syria, etc

6. I wonder if Netanyahu will sneak in the judicial reform since this war is the perfect distraction

7. Recently, Netanyahu showed a map of the 'New Middle East' without Palestine at the UN General Assembly (He likes his maps). Perhaps this can be the perfect excuse to make their plans for a Greater Israel a reality. Netanyahu also recently said his new war with Gaza will ""change the Middle East"". They have all of Jerusalem. They have been slowly taking over the West Bank, settlement by settlement aka a quiet annexation. Now all that's left is a takeover of Gaza.

8. To deflect from Israeli crimes/aggression against the Palestinians, get widespread support from the international community & paint Palestinians as villainous terrorists 

9. To stop funding for the Palestinians/Gaza from Qatar, Turkey, the US, the EU, etc

10. Perhaps they'll blame Iran and use this to escalate tensions/attack Iran. This would of course result in a huge, multinational war potentially dragging in the US/NATO, Lebanon, Iraq, Yemen, Syria, etc

Other things to consider- 

Let's not forget that it was Israel that created Hamas in the 1st place to divide/conquer the Palestinians 

This could slow down the Israeli-Saudi normalization process 

It may result in a third intifada in the West Bank

The longer and bloodier an Israeli response to Hamas is in not only Gaza but also the West Bank, the more likley chance of attacks against Israeli interests globally and within Israel itself

If Israel is successful in degrading Hamas governmentally and militarily aka oust Hamas from Gaza at least in terms of the control they have over the enclave, we can see a protracted war/insurgency

Would enemies of Netanyahu within Israel try to use the so called intel failure to oust Netanyahu?

It is also worth noting that the judicial proceedings in Israel were just starting to take place regarding the hearing of cases associated with the judicial reform when these attacks unfolded so that's very interesting 

A drawn-out regional conflict would block or at least postpone any official accountability for Netanyahu's failure to prevent Hamas’ attack from happening in the first place and could also put his multiple indictments on corruption charges on an indefinite hold

Also, Netanyahu himself said that this is going to be ""a long and difficult war"" and that Israel is ""just getting started"". These statements coupled with the fact that unlike 2014 when 80,000+ reservists were called up, this time, it's 300,000+ reservists. This most likley means a complete and prolonged occupation of Gaza is coming. They can just remain there indefinitely until the threat is eliminated aka how the US does things in the ME

This would just be the latest war/chapter of the story of perpetual war especially at a time of waning press coverage of the Ukraine war.

But 10seconds later when you question Israel's legitimacy then they suddenly become very religious old testament follower","Neo-atheists like Bill Maher, Sam Harris and others made a career mocking God. They mock prophet Muhammad and sometimes Moses. They made a career out of mocking Jesus. Bill Maher probably can't sleep at night before mocking Jesus.

These neo atheists are mostly centrist or center right.
Not sure if center left Destiny, Vaush and other Hillary Clinton also do this. But this is prevalent in Sam Harris neo-atheism fanbase.


But then I noticed something. Some of these neo-atheists start doing a mental gymnastics when it comes to Solomon, David (and sometimes about Moses too). It's like flipping a switch.
Solomon and David are important to zionism. Apparently Solomon built a temple or David beat Goliath inside the temple or somewhere.


Most zionists don't want to criticize Moses. Every scripture Moses is very important. Quran has more mentions of Moses than Muhammad. However some zionists or atheists claim that Moses got high in the mountains because allegedly there were marijuana in there.


Then there is God. There is one thing zionists hate is God. There is no way to sugarcoat it Zionists are god-hating. They hate God more than they hate Palestine.


But then Zionists also believe God promised him this land. It's almost like flipping a switch. You can't have it both ways. You can't just prostrate before the grave of pedo Robert Maxwell in the morning then in the afternoon talk about god promised land. -_- god forbidden you from prostrating before Robert you know



This is inexplicable to me. If you are a neo atheist, shouldn't you be like- fudge you all fudge all scriptures, let me just Netflix and popcorn, your scriptures never mentioned Netflix, video games or popcorn so they are invalid hehehe.


But why is this strange hypocrisy happening? Shouldn't people(neo atheist) be more intellectually consistent?
Go ask bill Maher about Jesus. Go ask Ben Shapiro(not atheist) about Jesus. They will start ranting about how Jesus allegedly was a 'fraud' and got killed by Romans for 'causing corruption in the land'. So they are using typical atheist talking points.

Then 10 seconds later ask them about Israel they will suddenly become very religious and big expert on old testament. No more atheistic propaganda when you question Israel's legitimacy?



Some say Maher Sam Harris are just trying to do history and not theology. Zionism is about history and not religion or something.



Okay. But there are other secular Jewish groups who point out zionists might be lying about archaeological evidence. There is no direct evidence linking Solomon to the temple walls. It's possible the temple walls are built much later, by Romans or Jews under Roman occupation or something.




This mental gymnastics only happens with the media personalities who are all zionists. If you have atheist friends who don't listen to Fox news CNN then they are probably not hypocrites when it comes to Israel and zionism. 


Is there any CorbettReport or Christopher Bollyn video or book about this theological issue? Let me know if they said anything.



Summary: zionists hate God but believe that God will give him/her a land called Palestine. Why do Zionist neo atheist (Harris-Maher fans) flip a switch in their brains and become theologians when you mention Israel, even though ten seconds ago they were ranting and raving about Jesus allegedly being 'a fraud magician' who got killed by Romans for 'causing trouble'

61,1739ult,2023-10-08,conspiracy,Hypocrisy During Times of Tragedy,"I believe that we can all agree that what happened in Israel on Oct 7, 2023 was a terrible tragedy especially when it comes to civilians being murdered, injured or taken hostage.

With that being said there needs to be proper context which is missing when it comes to the usual, one sided, MSM coverage regarding the events of Oct 7, 2023.

As much as I can't stand what happened in Israel, I also cannot stand that the international community/MSM continually ignore the pain/suffering of Palestinians that has been ongoing for decades since at least 1947.

What happened in Israel is actually directly linked to the suffering of Palestinians as well. Violence only begets more violence. 

The conspiracy here is that the MSM manages our perception by controlling the narrative to fit their pre-determined viewpoints and they do this by cherry-picking aka one sided news reporting and that the MSM are highly hypocritical by choosing to focus intensely upon certain events in the world while under-reporting others.

It comes down at least in part to a scale in which certain lives are sadly valued more than others as well as who is considered an ally vs who is an enemy.

The other hypocritical double standard here is that Israel wishes to claim a monopoly on ""legitimate"" violence while dismissing any and all resistance against it as ""terrorism"".

Why is it that when Hamas/PIJ carries out attacks against civilians, this is immediately labelled as terrorism but when Israel bombs apartment buildings, mosques, UNRWA schools, hospitals, the media, airports, refugee camps, etc in Gaza or elsewhere, this isn't condemned as terrorism?

There is moral equivalency between Hamas and the IDF.

The truth is that Israeli aggression and oppression has been ongoing with impunity and under the protection along with assistance from the US. 

As of Oct 10, 2023, only two days after Hamas attacked Israel and already Israel has murdered some 900+ Palestinians including 490+ women/children, 4,600+ wounded 200,000+, displaced, bombed mosques, apartments, hospitals & refugee camps, completely destroyed 790+ housing units, damaged a further 5,300+ housing units and also allegedly used the banned white phosphorus which they have a history of using & is a war crime. To top it off, they ordered a full siege upon Gaza aka a complete blockade therefore no food, electricity or fuel is allowed. This is a war crime and collective punishment. It is meant to starve the 2+ million people in Gaza to death. Hitler's Nazi Germany is known to have used starvation as a weapon as well. 

It is also worth noting the Western hypocrisy and double standard when it comes to its support of Ukraine while being occupied by Russia but no such support for Palestine that has been occupied by Israel for decades. If Ukraine has the right to resist, so does Palestine. 

Here are a few facts about the Israel-Palestine conflict that provides some context-

1. Israel has murdered or injured 150,000+ Palestinians since 2008 which includes about 33,000 children (This is just over the past 15 years without even considering all the deaths/injuries/destruction between 1947-2007 not just in Palestine but in Syria, Lebanon, etc

2. What the MSM isn't reporting as much as the violence upon Israel is an increase of settler violence upon Palestinians, the increase of illegal settlement building and the frequency of storming/raiding the third holiest site in Islam, the Al Aqsa Masjid, which happened yet again a few days before the attacks launched by Hamas when hundreds of settlers stormed the holy site. Such events have only increased under the ultra-nationalist Israeli gov led by Netanyahu

3. Due to the power imbalance between Israel and Palestine, the lack of protection for Gaza compared to all the levels of security that Israel has, Israel's pattern of over-responding and ever increasing US military aid to Israel, thousands of more Palestinians are usually killed/injured compared to Israeli casualties. This is what happens literally every time Israel and Gaza go to war. As of Oct 9, 2023, 900+ Israelis have sadly died and 2,500+ have been injured. These numbers are a 1st for Israel not seen in decades but for Palestine, it's the norm.

4. Gaza is the largest open air prison in the world. It has been blockaded by Egypt and Israel since 2005 aka 18 years. Gaza is essentially a concentration camp. No one gets in or out without Israeli approval. Aid to Gaza needs Israeli approval. Rights and freedoms of the Palestinians are restricted. Movement is restricted. Israel can turn on and off aid, electricity, etc to Gaza whenever they want. The Palestinians are under constant surveillance. Basically, Israel can do what it, wants when it wants and is in complete control.

5. Israel currently has about 4,500 Palestinian captives in its prisons. They use euphemistic terms like ""arrest"" to legitimize their capturing/kidnapping/forceful confinement of Palestinians

6. In 2022 alone, over 200 Palestinians were murdered by Israel and another 200+ in 2023 so far excluding the events of Oct 7, 2023-present

This was a three-pronged movement which aimed at the capture of the three vital points of a state's defences: state policy at the top level, the civil services at the middle level and “public opinion” or the mass-mind at the base. The way in which control over acts of state policy was achieved (through the “adviserships” which became part of American political life after 1913) has already been shown, this part of the process having preceded the others. The methods used to attempt the capture of government services will be discussed later in this chapter. In what immediately follows, the capture of the mass-mind in America, through control of published information, will be described; it was indispensable to the other two thrusts.*

*This form of political invasion is called by Dr. Weizmann, who exhaustively studied it in his youth, when he was preparing in Russia for his life's work in the west, “the technique of propaganda and the approach to the masses.” The operation so described may now be studied in actual operation:*

The little offshoot of 1913, the “Anti-Defamation League,” had by 1947 become a secret police of formidable power in America.*",sudo-tleilaxu,t2_bwrx8,0.69,28,3

To me this current conflict for sure sounds like a fitting even regarding this prediction. Its also interesting that he seemed to have very good foresight on the WW1 and WW2 in this same letter, which like already pointed out, was written in 1871. In the letter he wrote regarding WW1 and WW2:

>The First World War must be brought about in order to permit the Illuminati to overthrow the power of the Czars in Russia and of making that country a fortress of atheistic Communism. The divergences caused by the ""agentur"" (agents) of the Illuminati between the British and Germanic Empires will be used to foment this war.

Having stated that, how could Israel have been unaware on October 9, 2023, that Hamas had built thousands of rockets to rain down on Israel? Israel maintains military control over the Gaza region and is blind.

It might have been air-dropped or smuggled, but as an example, my Syrian friend claims that Israel has used rockets to quickly bring down cargo cars from Syria to Iraq containing weapons. How can Israel not notice that Hamas is manufacturing or smuggling thousands of rockets? 

 I believe that Israel had this planned out as an elaborate scheme to dupe the Hamas in order to finally eliminate Hamas and put an end to their attacks on Israeli territory. By appearing blind to Hamas' activities, Israel could gain a reason before launching a decisive war.

I don't know, could be nothing, maybe I forgot to take my schizoid pills today but I just thought it was interesting. **Could** be unrelated.

My biggest fear is that this could embroil us into a much larger conflict. Here are my slippery slope ramblings.

Here me out:

1. The national emergency test notification happens
2. Hamas attacks Israel
3. Israel attacks back, with heavy U.S. backing
4. Hamas or a Hamas-affiliated terror organization attacks U.S. soil, like 9-11 2 electric boogaloo except it probably won't be a plane->tower again, maybe a mass shooting or bombing, idk. U.S. will know it's happening but will let it happen, but will have a rapid response to minimize post-disaster chaos thanks to the national emergency notification.
5. U.S. retaliates back, like before (boots on ground, potentially--heavy drone strikes minimum).
6. Iran, being on friendly terms with Hamas, either declares war against the U.S. or comes awfully close to it, and U.S. responds
7. This then puts the U.S. into conflict with Russia, who is also friendly with Iran and doesn't want the U.S. messing around with the oil pipelines.
8. With U.S. backing Ukraine and messing around in the middle east against Palestine and Iran, this pushes Russia over the edge and causes further escalation, potentially a nuclear threat.
9. War time!

&#x200B;

The Warhawks will be overjoyed. The President's plummeting approval ratings will skyrocket. Lots of people die to help with population control (which a lot of elites seem to want to happen). Nuclear war isn't a big threat, as many of the elite have access to bunkers. Le funny reset.

Everything I said above will probably (hopefully) not happen and I've probably worn my tinfoil hat for too long, please take this with a grain of salt. I just thought it was interesting food for thought. If even half of what I wrote comes true...well...I guess you can call me a prophet or whatever.

*""Hamas, to my great regret, is Israel's creation,"" says Mr. Cohen, a Tunisian-born Jew who worked in Gaza for more than two decades. Responsible for religious affairs in the region until 1994, Mr. Cohen watched the Islamist movement take shape, muscle aside secular Palestinian rivals and then morph into what is today Hamas, a militant group that is sworn to Israel's destruction.*

*Instead of trying to curb Gaza's Islamists from the outset, says Mr. Cohen, Israel for years tolerated and, in some cases, encouraged them as a counterweight to the secular nationalists of the Palestine Liberation Organization and its dominant faction, Yasser Arafat's Fatah. Israel cooperated with a crippled, half-blind cleric named Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, even as he was laying the foundations for what would become Hamas. Sheikh Yassin continues to inspire militants today; during the recent war in Gaza, Hamas fighters confronted Israeli troops with ""Yassins,"" primitive rocket-propelled grenades named in honor of the cleric.*

*Meanwhile, the activities of Islamists affiliated with Egypt's banned Muslim Brotherhood were allowed in the open in Gaza — a radical departure from when the Strip was administered by the secular-nationalist Egyptian government of Gamal Abdel Nasser. Egypt lost control of Gaza to Israel after the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, which saw Israel also seize the West Bank. In 1966, Nasser had executed Sayyid Qutb, one of the Brotherhood's leading intellectuals. The Israelis saw Qutb's adherents in the Palestinian territories, including the wheelchair-bound Sheik Ahmed Yassin, as a useful counterweight to Arafat's PLO.*

**Technique**

The impact of Zionism on humanity is deeper, broader, more nuanced,  more toxic, more censored, and more obfuscated than just about anyone  seems to understand, so we will each have to tap into the power of our  subconscious to find patterns among the millions of data points already  in our brains. To be sure, we will also look at a large amount of  directly relevant evidence. I recommend reading this whole article  before following the hyperlinks.

**Preface**

Everyone is good, and everyone is beautiful. More specifically, the  best version of everyone is good, and the best version of everyone is  beautiful.

There are no bad people. There are only people who are in a bad place  …. because they have lost their way …. because everyone is being  played.

[The Apex Players](https://leagueofrealpeople.com/the-apex-players/)  (above Presidents and billionaires) are trying to turn every one of us  into the worst version of ourselves. They are trying to make us dislike,  distrust, and distance each other …. so that we are looking at each  other instead of looking at them, and so that we cannot unite against  them.

That is not who we really are or who we really want to be.

It is always within everyone’s power to find their way again.

Everyone is redeemable—even the Apex Players.

I live in a universe full of beauty and wonder. How can I feel  anything but gratitude for having had the chance to leave the universe  better than if I had never existed.

**What is Zionism?**

We will define Zionism by the actions of the most dominant Zionists.

Zionism is the belief that Jewish people have a right to go to the  Middle East and initiate as much fraud and aggression as they want for  the purpose of taking any land they want—without ethical constraint. For  example, murder, genocide, ethnic cleansing, and Apartheid are  acceptable actions to Zionists.

A majority of Zionists are not Jewish—just as a majority who support the dominant LGBT agenda are not LGBT.

Likewise, not all Jews are Zionists—just as not all LGBTs support the dominant LGBT agenda.

A very large percentage (possibly a majority) of American Christians are Zionists.

Almost all of the global establishment is Zionist.

Conflation of Zionism, Israelis, and Jews is a common tactic of Zionists. Such obfuscation hurts Jews and is thus antisemitic.

Some of the best people in the world are Jews—much like how some of the best people in the world are black.

Everyone is being played. [The Apex Players](https://leagueofrealpeople.com/the-apex-players/)  (above billionaires and presidents) are Zionist in their actions, but  they are not true believers. They do not care about the average Jew or  Israeli. Zionism is just a means to an end.

Below the Apex Players are Zionists who are not exactly true  believers, but who do care about what they see as the Alpha Jews. They  want to scrub the human gene pool of the lesser Jews—much like how Alpha  Blacks hate lesser blacks.

**Why should you care?**

The Apex Players seem to think that Zionism is one of their most  important manipulations (plays), so given that the totality of actions  by the Apex Players is tantamount to a declaration of war against all of  humanity, and given that Zionism is one of their most harmful plays  across all of humanity, it is thus in the best interests of humanity to  derail Zionism.

We can be more specific.

First, you should always care about genocide, slavery, ethnic  cleansing, initiations of force and fraud, the illusion of legitimacy,  organized crime, tribalism, dominance hierarchy, and conformism. Such  cancers on humanity can spread; whereas, the more freedom and dignity  humanity has, the more everyone benefits.

Second, Zionism is a product of the Apex Players, who control those who control you.

Third, Zionists have been particularly destructive to the Middle East  and to America, so if you are in one of those countries, you are being  harmed more than most. If you are in Western Europe, you are  experiencing a flood of Muslim immigrants caused by America’s wars in  the Middle East that only benefit Israel.

Fourth, many countries punish those who speak out against the Zionist  narrative. You can go to jail for three years in Norway and five years  in Russia. Even Canada recently added jail time. Punishments in America  still fall short of jail.

**What do true believers argue is the justification for Zionism?**

True believers originally argued one or both of the following justifications for Zionism.

The first original justification is religion, which is that God gave  all of the land in that region to the Jews (the descendants of Jacob)  over 2000 years ago. Most Israelis don’t believe this, but they promote  the idea anyway because many American Christians are easily fooled by  this argument. Of course, claiming God is on one’s side is never a  sufficient justification for initiating force or fraud—let alone  invasion, genocide, Apartheid, ethnic cleansing, or other atrocities.

The second original justification is ethnicity. The European invaders  claim to be the descendants of Hebrews who lived in the land until  about 70 AD when the Romans killed almost all of them, and a remnant  fled the region. They say that every ethnicity deserves a homeland, and  that this one is theirs. Of course, ethnicity as a justification is just  racism, tribalism, and dominance hierarchy. Ethnicity is never a  sufficient justification for initiating force or fraud—let alone  invasion, genocide, Apartheid, ethnic cleansing, or other atrocities.

My best estimate from the data I have seen is that European Jews are  about 8% Semitic and 1% Hebrew, but we don’t need data to tell us what  is self-evident. European Jews look European. They do not look like  Arabs. Of course, it would make no difference whether they were 0% or  100% Hebrew, but maybe such data will help derail some support for  Zionism.

Related to both arguments is that the Apex Players would also have us  believe that Zionism has existed since 70 AD, and that the rest of  humanity just wouldn’t let the Hebrews return, but as we have already  explained, religion and ethnicity are not justifications for Zionism,  and in the case of Zionism’s roots, we have the additional fact that [Zionism ](http://leagueofrealpeople.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Google-Books-Ngram-Viewer-Zionism-1800-2019.png)[became a thing in the 1890’s. It was relatively unknown until the 1920’s, ](http://leagueofrealpeople.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Google-Books-Ngram-Viewer-Zionism-1800-2019.png)[and](http://leagueofrealpeople.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Google-Books-Ngram-Viewer-Zionism-1800-2019.png)[ it got little traction until it spiked during WWII](http://leagueofrealpeople.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Google-Books-Ngram-Viewer-Zionism-1800-2019.png).

Since then, Zionists have added a third justification, which is that  Zionism is justified because Israelis are just better and/or more  powerful people, but that is just more racism, tribalism, and dominance  hierarchy.

Zionism is an extreme manifestation of the [Soul of Animals](https://endofinnocence.com/the-soul-of-animals/),  and as such, is a dead-end path for humanity—especially now that  humanity has the power to make itself extinct and/or do enormous harm to  the planet. The only way forward is the [Soul of Humanity](https://endofinnocence.com/the-soul-of-humanity/).

**How it began**

Since before we were human, one tribe did it to another. Native  American tribes did it to each other. European tribes did it to Native  American tribes, until …. one day …. in 1945 …. all the tribes of men  said ENOUGH! NEVER AGAIN!

Then, three years later, some European invaders who felt ***more entitled than anyone in history*** …. DID IT AGAIN! They are still doing it! Humanity is forced to look the other way!

There have been countless atrocities in which the European invaders  killed Palestinians, bulldozed their homes, or took their homes at gun  point. Over one million Palestinians have been killed or evicted by such  ethnic cleansing. Some survivors have been forced into the Gaza strip,  which is an open-air prison. The rest have been forced into the West  Bank, where they live under brutal totalitarian rule. Palestinians  inside Israel are second class citizens.

There have been many Zionist operations/scams that have installed  Jews into Palestine. Let’s listen to the story the Hadid family and the  particular scam they experienced.

I have heard no good reason to doubt that, between 1947 and 1949, the  European invaders forced at least 750,000 Palestinians to become  refugees, stole more than 78 percent of the land, ethnically cleansed  and destroyed about 530 villages and cities, and killed about 15,000  Palestinians in a series of mass atrocities, including more than 70  massacres.

In spite of total control of global media by Zionists, there has  still been sufficient global outrage to forestall the most extreme  levels of genocide, Apartheid, ethnic cleansing, and assorted atrocities  so desired by the European invaders. Although Zionists control the  global establishment, Israel is still struggling to maintain the  illusion of legitimacy.

**How it progressed**

I think it is fair to say that JFK was assassinated a few months  after he stated his intent to: 1) force the already very power Israeli  lobby known as AIPAC to register as a foreign lobby, 2) return control  of central banking to Congress, and 3) inspect the Dimona nuclear  facility in Israel.

David ben Gurion had said that JFK’s position threatened Israel’s very survival.

Zionists were already very concerned when JFK took office because, as stated by Edward Renehan about JFK’s father, Joseph:

>As fiercely anti-Communist as they were anti-Semitic, Kennedy and  Astor looked upon Adolf Hitler as a welcome solution to both of these  “world problems” (Nancy’s phrase)….. Kennedy replied that he expected  the “Jew media” in the United States to become a problem, that “Jewish  pundits in New York and Los Angeles” were already making noises  contrived to “set a match to the fuse of the world”  
 

That all ended a few months later with JFK’s assassination by the CIA (and others) in 1963.

Lest one think that the American establishment was not sufficiently  controlled by Zionists in 1963 to assassinate JFK, consider that in  1967, [the US government and Israel conspired to sink the USS Liberty, kill everyone on board, and blame Egypt](https://endofinnocence.com/uss-liberty-israel-attacked-america/).  Israel nearly succeed in their false flag event, and American planes  carrying nukes were already on their way to Cairo, but the extraordinary  heroism of the crew of the USS Liberty prevented successful completion  of the false flag event.

Do you think Israel’s influence over the US establishment increased or decreased after 1967? Consider that [Israel knew all about 9/11 before it happened](https://twitter.com/JimAtEOI/status/1719003715854565769), and that Israel is the only country that benefited from 9/11.

On October 7, 2023, Israel did everything it could to ensure that a  Hamas attack from Gaza inflicted maximum damage—100 times more than  should have been possible. Palestinians did not benefit from this  attack, but much like how only Israel benefited from 9/11, only Israel  benefited from this Hamas attack. Perhaps it would be more accurate to  say that only Zionists benefited from this attack.

Listen to how four Israeli leaders responded:

1) [Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli Prime Minister, said this about the 2.3 million people in Gaza](http://leagueofrealpeople.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Zionism-Israeli-Prime-Minister-Benjamin-Netanyahu-quote-we-will-turn-Gaza-into-an-island-of-ruins.jpg)[ (50% are children) ](http://leagueofrealpeople.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Zionism-Israel-defense-Minister-Yoav-Gallant-quote-fighting-animal-people.jpg)[on 10/8/23 in a television speech, “We will turn Gaza into an Island of ruins.”](http://leagueofrealpeople.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Zionism-Israeli-Prime-Minister-Benjamin-Netanyahu-quote-we-will-turn-Gaza-into-an-island-of-ruins.jpg)

We are fighting animal people, and we are acting accordingly.”](http://leagueofrealpeople.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Zionism-Israel-defense-Minister-Yoav-Gallant-quote-fighting-animal-people.jpg)

3) [Ghassan  Alian, Major General of the Israeli Army, said this about the people of  Gaza on 10/9/23 in an address on social media, “Animal humans will be  treated accordingly. You wanted Hell and will get Hell.”](http://leagueofrealpeople.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Zionism-major-general-of-Israeli-army-Ghassan-Alian-quote-animal-humans.jpg)

4) [Daniel  Hagari, an Israeli army spokesperson, said this about about Gaza as  reported on 10/10/23 in the Haaretz newspaper, “We are dropping hundreds  of tons of bombs on Gaza.

Now Israel has a pretext to do what it has always wanted to do. If  Hamas worked for Israel, the attack would have gone the same way. It is  almost as if ….

For many years, I have observed how the Zionist controlled Western  media speak incessantly about “Hamas rockets”, and they rarely mention  “Israeli missiles”.

**Ukraine too?**

I guess Ukraine is the only American war that is not about Israel …. or is it?

Ukraine is widely considered to have the highest concentration of  Nazis, Nazi sympathizers, and Nazi adjacent people in the world.

Consider that the war in Ukraine can be summarized as an ongoing  cycle in which the US stands up Ukrainian men and Russia knocks them  down again. Ukrainian men have been ground up between the US and Russia  until few are left—No more Nazis.

However, Ukrainian men weren’t hurting anyone, so the US had to do a  coup in 2014 under Obama/Biden to be able to make a future war look  natural. Then the US installed Zelensky some time after that. The  puppets installed by US Zionists have been shelling their own people for  years now. (Did I mention Zelensky is Jewish? That’s right. We are  supposed to believe that Nazis elected a Jewish President.)

Zionism is a significant part of why we now live in [The Toxic Age](https://leagueofrealpeople.com/toxic-age/).

And they are still doing it! And  all of humanity is forced to look the other way! The aliens would  conclude that they could not allow humanity’s toxicity to spread to the  rest of the galaxy, so they would have to quarantine Earth indefinitely.

Humanity has lost its way. Not only did humanity abandon the epiphany  of Never Again, but the entire global establishment violated the  Nuremberg Code (during Covid), which was developed at about the same  time—both in reaction to Nazism. They even violated the entire Bill of  Rights!

(One way to do that would be to find the wherewithal to accept [The Pledge](https://leagueofrealpeople.com/pledge/).)

Ending Zionism is not enough.

So great are the crimes of Zionism that it would not be a sufficient  solution if 100% of Palestinians said the European invaders could stay.  That is because: 1) Palestinians have been placed under so much duress  that they cannot possibly be in a position to make such a choice. 2)  Palestinians have been bred to be submissive. Those who stand up for  themselves are killed. 3) All of humanity has now suffered the effects  of Zionism.

Zionism is a crime against humanity—not just Palestinians.

Even if Zionists accomplished their dream of exterminating every Palestinian, the stain of Zionism would remain.

When the war was declared, corrupted governments started to commit democides by locking down their countries, their economies and healthcare systems, ending the lives of at least 12 million people worldwide.

He might be conducting human sacrifice as his ancient predecessors, in his bombing of Gaza. He might also be emulating Herod and trying to kill a messiah by massacring the innocent. Hamas was founded with help of Israel. It might be a tool for killings, power, and sowing hatred worldwide. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is widely known among Christians the story of the [Massacre of the Innocents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massacre_of_the_Innocents). After Jesus Christ Emanuel was born, Herod, the usurper of the throne of Israel, learned by the visiting Magi that a new king had been born. Worried that he could get deposed, he ordered the killing of all the babies and toddlers of Bethlehem up to 2 years old.

Fast forward to the present times, Hamas, which runs the government of Gaza, conducted an attack in Israel which resulted in the deaths of hundreds. Many of those targeted were innocent families, including children, who were killed in horrific ways which may have been in nature ritualistic.

The Prime Minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, in retaliation to the atrocities of Hamas and reportedly to take them out, ordered a widespread bombing of Gaza. This has resulted in the deaths of thousands of innocent people, including [more than 3,000 children](https://www.businessinsider.com/israel-gaza-hamas-civilian-casualties-children-deaths-airstrikes-palestinian-2023-10?op=1).

Hamas is an organization that was founded surprisingly with [direct help](https://theintercept.com/2018/02/19/hamas-israel-palestine-conflict/) from the government of Israel. Reportedly the objective was to create a divide in Palestinians between the secular leftists and the religious right.

Through the years, specially during the administrations of right wing politicians, the government of Israel has only added fuel to the hatred of Palestinians towards Israel. Although certainly crowd control and security issues are a concern in any government, Israel has the peculiarity that it carries out needless abuses even in front of international news teams.

Any competent leader and any public relations professional knows the effect that such dramatic shows of abuse to a worldwide audience can have. It is one of the most important ways to help boost recruitment to terrorist organizations not only in Palestine but across the world and increases their popularity with Muslims and others.

The government of Israel headed mainly by right wing politicians has completely failed to coordinate any public relations campaign to try to win over the hearts of the Palestinians. It looks more like it is interested in creating hate and more hate against the Jewish people. Apart from the secular advantages this creates (military contracts, government power, surreptitious killing of dissidents), this may have occult reasons as well, as there are people who seek secretly to sow suffering, chaos, destruction, and death in the world. Many of them are worshippers of the Beast or Evil itself.

Since ancient times we can read in the Bible how there were societies who worshipped evil entities and even sacrificed children by the sword or in the fire. We are now seeing how both Hamas and Netanyahu are sacrificing children by the sword and the fire.

Again, any competent leader would know that killing so many innocent people, even in retaliation for a murderous attack, would multiply exponentially the hatred against Jewish people worldwide. It seems that Netanyahu either doesn't care or is explicitly and secretly seeking that for unknown ulterior purposes. Let's remember that in the books of Chronicles in the Bible we can read that there were many evil rulers of Israel, who even conducted human sacrifice. Netanyahu, with all the killings and hatred he is unleashing worldwide is certainly an evil ruler, who is emulating the ancient child sacrifices and the massacre of the Innocent that Herod did to try to kill Jesus.

Let's remember that the Jewish people are still waiting for the Messiah. Maybe Netanyahu heard of the possible birth of someone who in his opinion could be the Messiah and is trying to kill him.",freethinker78,t2_5fvv99m,0.63,10,2

96,177pxd5,2023-10-14,conspiracy,They knew the attack on Israel was coming... Palestine will be no more.,"I can't help but speculate on these matters, as they seem to have far-reaching implications that deserve our attention. Beyond the immediate threat of an incoming attack, there is a troubling pattern where such attacks are used as a pretext to reclaim territory. What exacerbates this concern is the apparent support and endorsement from the United States. It's essential to recognize that Israel, on occasion, acts as a provocateur in the region, exploiting any opportunity to expand its territory at the expense of Palestine when both countries deserve existence. 

Furthermore, those who closely follow Middle Eastern politics are acutely aware of Israel's role as a testing ground for Republican America's security policies, which include mandatory military service and a media landscape that exclusive presents a one-sided narrative, favoring Israel while vilifying Palestine serving to manipulate Americans towards religion. These developments raise legitimate concerns about how this situation could be manipulated to shape domestic U.S. politics.

As for the impact on the average U.S. citizen, it's worth noting that such actions can have significant consequences. A continued alignment with a region where military conflicts persist can lead to greater military expenditures, potentially affecting taxpayers and diverting resources from domestic priorities like healthcare, education, and infrastructure. Additionally, a narrative that fosters religious and militaristic fervor may influence the national discourse, potentially leading to societal divisions and a departure from core principles of tolerance and diplomacy. In essence, these international dynamics have the potential to shape the daily lives and beliefs of everyday Americans.

TLDR; this war is a republicans wet dream and Palestine will be no more at the hands of religion. ",FallenPillar,t2_m9ji4yhf,0.62,12,6

They'll do this not only to support Israel but as a form of PR to make Israel ""look better"" while ensuring that the oppressed/the victims ""look bad."" This is meant to draw sympathy away from the victim and garner support for the aggressor. These are the reasons for their psyops.

As Malcom X once said, ""If you aren't careful, the newspapers will have you hating the people who are being oppressed and loving the people who are doing the oppressing.""

Of course, it goes without saying that the fog of war clouds our vision of reality and ensures that our attempts to grasp the truth remains difficult.

However, Israeli apologists will gladly believe the stats produced by the Israeli gov/military or the narratives of their supporters like the US while questioning the stats of the Palestinians.

In truth, due to the density of Gaza and the widespread, continuous, unprecedented nature of Israel's bombing campaign, it is very likely that there is in fact a high casualty count for the Palestinians as there usually is. Furthermore, lying will not result in a favourable outcome for the Palestinians.

Plus, international entities like the UN and HRW have vouched for data released by Palestine before and the Gaza Health Ministry released the names and gov ID's of thousands of victims of Israel.

&#x200B;

Here are the latest numbers as of Nov 3, 2023-

Last week Israel suggested that they hit over 12,000 targets in Gaza. Palestinian reports indicate that as much as 18,000 tonnes of bombs have been dropped on Gaza.

So far, in less than a month, between Oct 7, 2023 and Nov 3, 2023 an estimated 9,000+ deaths have been reported in Gaza.

Furthermore, an estimated 32,000 injuries have been reported in Gaza.

Over 2,000+ are currently missing in Gaza.

130+ have been killed in the West Bank.

Over, 2,000+ have been injured in the West Bank.

Almost 4,000 children are among the dead in Gaza.

The overwhelming vast majority of these victims are civilians.

This brings the total to an est.  43,000+ Palestinians.

ALL OF THIS CARNAGE AND DEATH IN UNDER A MONTH.

Even the brutal Russian war in Ukraine did not result in this many deaths or injuries on average or over the course of the same period of time. It has been raging for 1.8 years and has resulted in anywhere between 25,000-90,000 civilian casualties. Yet Russia was condemned far more than Israel has been not to mention the unprecedented sanctions package Russia had to endure vs Israel having no such punishment levied against it.

For the Russian war, the number of dead and injured range from about 1,250 to 4,500 per month.

However, the current Israel-Gaza war has so far managed 43,000+ casualties in less than a month.

Apparently, the families of Israeli victims of Hamas' brutal attack in Israel are filing genocide claims with the ICC. As terrible as the Hamas attack upon Israel was, the actual genocide is occurring in Gaza.

If Israel continues at this pace of killing/injuring in Palestine with an estimated 43,000 casualties per month on average, the entire Gazan population of 2.3 million people of whom 50% are children will either be dead or injured in about 54 MONTHS aka 4.5 YEARS. Netanyahu did say this would be a long war.

Of course, we haven't even looked at all of the ways ppl are dying that aren't directly related to the bombs or ground invasion but could be linked to the siege/blockade of Gaza.

This is what an actual GENOCIDE looks like. We are witnessing this in real time and the international community is doing very little to stop this madness.",Puzzlebrain21,t2_b5n15jrl,0.59,11,20

Bush," We have compiled here resources on the terrorist activities of Bush, from the US Intelligence planned attack on The Twin Towers on September 11, to slaughtering of millions of innocent civilians in Palestine, Afghanistan, Iraq and recently Lebanon.

For the attention of readers, George W. Bush is a 'born again Christian', the term well known to fundamentalist Masonic Christians, denoting the initiation of new members into their (Masonic) form of Christianity.

The Evangelical Christian Movement of Bush can be traced back to The Crusades and The Knights Templars under whose occupation of Palestine in 1066 A.D., 60,000 Palestinian civilians had been ruthlessly slaughtered. And today, their descendants while holding the highest level of American governmental positions are launching the same Crusades, towards not just Palestine but also Afghanistan, Lebanon and Iraq.

We believe that the American occupation of the Muslim world is just continuation of centuries long Crusades between Anti-messianic Christians and the Muslims.

Truly, The White House is under occupation of Fundamentalist 'Anti-christian' Christians, working in collaboration with Israel. Both together with Iran are waiting for the same Messiah; Christ, Moshiach and The Twelth Imam may possibly be the same person.

The field was found to contain enough natural gas to supply the  Palestinian territories with it and also have a surplus for export,  which would make the Palestinian territories more energy independent.

>Despite many attempts to strike a deal with BG to open  the Gaza Marine gas field, it is still unexploited. Two of the main  parties involved in the negotiations are the Israel Electric Corporation  (IEC) and Egypt, who seek to convert the natural gas into liquefied  natural gas to export.[\[1\]](https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/natural-gas-palestinian-authority-potential-gaza-marine-offshore-field)  The gas field remains unexploited for political and historical reasons;  however, when it was first discovered, media coverage projected it to  be a subject that could offer benefits to both Israelis and  Palestinians, potentially leading to cooperation and negotiation between  both parties.\[3\]  
>  
>The gas fields that lie under the Mediterranean do not conform to  national borders. Lebanon and Egypt objected to Israel’s claims to  certain gas fields, and Israel has tightened ties with Cyprus over gas  field negotiations. Regionally, the discovery of gas fields has led to  increased tension between these closely placed countries.\[3\]  
>  
>Maritime law and Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories  also complicates the question of who owns the Gaza Marine gas field.  Although it is legally under the jurisdiction of the Palestinian  Authority as a result of the Oslo Accords, Israeli forces have prevented  Palestinians physical access to the offshore region and its resources.[\[3\]](https://doi.org/10.1525/jps.2013.42.3.29)

111,17ew5tr,2023-10-23,conspiracy,Hostage Hypocrisy,"Israeli apologists keep emphasizing the fact that Hamas currently has an estimated 222 hostages being held capitive in Gaza 

&#x200B;

The situation these 222 or so hostages are in right now is heartbreaking and terrible. I wish for their safe return home as soon as possible 

&#x200B;

Israel claims to care dearly about them. However, the highly controversial economy minister of Israel, Nir Barakat, said the following-

&#x200B;

""Hostages and civilian casualties will be secondary to destroying Hamas, Israel's Economy Minister Nir Barakat told ABC News, ""even if it takes a year."" Asked about the miles of tunnels Hamas has built under Gaza, he said they'd become the ""world's biggest cemetery."" (Does that include the hostages that may be there which he claimed are secondary?)

&#x200B;

With all the talk of Israeli/duel citizen hostages held by Hamas/PIJ, what has been overlooked by the international community is the following- 

&#x200B;

Did you know that as much as 4,000+ Gazans who were working in Israel at the time of the attacks on Oct 7, 2023 have been ""detained"" by Israeli authorities indefinetly, without charge, legal representation, etc. NOTHING

&#x200B;

They are being kept in Israeli military facilities in the West Bank

&#x200B;

They did NOTHING other than work/be physically present in Israel with the permission of Israel at the time of the attacks and they were targeted simply b/c they are Palestinians from Gaza

&#x200B;

Sound familiar? 

&#x200B;

It reminds you of the Israeli hostages taken/targeted by Hamas just for being Israeli and just for being in Israel at the time but many do not care for these Gazan hostages held by Israel

&#x200B;

Notice the language being used to officialize the kidnapping of these Gazans. Terms like ""detain"", ""arrest"", ""prisoner"", etc are being used rather than ""captive"" or ""hostage""

&#x200B;

These Gazans were forcefully taken and are being held captive by Israeli authorities. They are being forcefully confined just like the hostages held by Hamas

&#x200B;

What about the fact that Gaza has been turned into the largest, open air prison via Israel's 18 year blockade and everyone inside has become a hostage of Israel as it is Israel that refuses to let them out unless it's to exploit them for cheap, slave labour such as what was discussed in the Yinon Plan

&#x200B;

Further to this, since Oct 7, 2023, some 1,200 Palestinians in the West Bank have been rounded up by the Israeli military

&#x200B;

Even before Oct 7, 2023, Israel had upwards of 5,200 Palestinians in its prison system

&#x200B;

This would bring the total number of Palestinians held by Israel to about 10,000


&#x200B;

Israeli apologists will call all of the Palestinian captives, ""terrorists"" or ""security threats"" but several of them are being held simply for ""overstaying"" in Israel & even children who are caught throwing rocks during violent Israeli raids can face up to 20 years in prison 

&#x200B;

From the Palestinian point of view, I'm sure they would want to ""detain"" all of the members of the IDF currently taking part in violent, terroristic actions in Gaza & the West Bank. I'm sure they'd want to ""arrest"" any Israeli currently in an illegal settlement in occupied land, internationally recognized as being part of Palestine

&#x200B;

Going back to the 4,000+ Gazan hostages being held capitive by Israel since Oct 7, the following has been reported- 

&#x200B;

Six Israeli rights groups have filed a petition to the supreme court regarding the thousands of Palestinians from the Gaza Strip currently being held by Israel in detention centers against their will and without legal basis

&#x200B;

In the petition, the organisations request that the court instruct the Israeli army, prison services and police to disclose the names and whereabouts of all Gaza residents being held in Israeli detention centers and release any persons unlawfully ""detained"" to the West Bank until they are able to return to the coastal enclave

&#x200B;

The organisations are HaMoked: Center for the Defence of the Individual, Gisha, the Public Committee Against Torture in Israel, Physicians for Human Rights Israel, Adalah and The Association for Civil Rights in Israel

&#x200B;

As the war erupted, workers found they were unable to return home to Gaza and, fearing for their lives, many attempted to make their way to the West Bank, hoping to find shelter with local residents, the groups said

&#x200B;

On October 10, Israel’s Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT) revoked all work permits it had previously issued to Gaza residents, turning them into “illegal aliens” from Israel’s perspective

&#x200B;

“The Israeli army and police have since ""detained"" Palestinians from Gaza and placed them in Israeli detention facilities against their will, without legal authority and without legal grounds. Some were ""detained"" violently in Israel, others at checkpoints en route to the West Bank, and some even in areas of the West Bank that are ""controlled"" by the Palestinian Authority,” the groups said

&#x200B;

So basically, heavily armed Israeli ""soldiers"" aka ""fighters"" kidnapped innocent, Palestinian Gazans off the streets, sometimes violently, even going as far as invading Palestinian territory to do this & are now holding them hostage/captive.

This is just another means for the elite cartel weapon manufacturers to make endless amounts of money. Nothing less or more. (It’s also a huge distraction to the masses while they are passing things left and right behind the scenes)

What the elite want is a drastic population decrease. Wars don’t lower the population fast enough and won’t prevent the population from exploding again. They never have.  

Ultimately what will however is the coming AI that’s fast encroaching upon us that will cause a MASSIVE amount of job losses and the ultimate destruction of our democratic systems. It’ll change even the concept of money and work, all that weve known thus far. 

With such a big change coming our way, they know at the top that there’s going to have to be a system change, however the system they want to implement cannot house the population we currently have. They need drastically lower numbers. 

I foresee that there will be total chaos in the next 5-6 years as AI starts advancing and leaving millions of people jobless in all sectors. They’ll sit back and allow the masses to destroy society with anarchy and chaos, they’ll sit back as people go hungry and homeless. Then once the population numbers get to a point where it’s manageable on a UBI-like system they’ll come in with their new system. 

I think humans will be like how horses are today. In the past horses were needed for everything. So a whole economy was built around them. Then cars came. Where do we see horses now? We hardly see them. And if we do seem them, they’re out in plantations or ranches and small in number. They’re a rare sight. I think they want humans like this because they’re more controllable. 

So they’ve realized in order to ultimately decrease the human population they need to take away the need for humans, which is the AI.

I think this is especially important today because its possibly yet another polarization where those see it, for example, the way Kanye seems to, end up getting pushed to the other side which basically ends up in the same place.

Just like how the red v blue game works, but another level up. Its all very, Masonic and Hegelian. 

There are many things to support this, which I'm also beginning to believe have some merit.

The commemorative coin with a swastika and star of David together marking some partnership between the 2. (Ie: 2 halves of the same coin). 

Similarly the zionist Stern Gang (tried to or did) partner with Hitler to get a state of Israel in Palestine. The cofounder of which became the founder of the dominant political party of modern day Israel and a former PM.

Then there's the genetic angle. 23 and me censored its own results that showed eastern European, Kazarian dissent for these ""jews"" (JINOs).

Then, why is a group of very genetically homogeneous people from a predominantly brown region of the world white?

Then theres Ukraine today. Many can't fathom how a Jewish Zelensky would partner with Azov Nazis. Well, this answers that question quite well.

Then theres the fact that Zionists and Nation Socialist Nazis basically advocate for the same thing. A centrally controlled, kabbalistic and religious ethno state.

Last thing I will list (but there IS more), is OP Paperclip after WW2. We brought 1600 Nazis over to the US that basically started everything from NASA to the CIA.

BUT today those institutions are largely Jewish controlled. When did that massive power shift occur? And why did it happen so subtly? Seems like that would be big news if only in the conspiracy realm, but you don't even hear about it here.

Could it be that the SAME people simply changed names?!

I personally feel like that whole alternative reality story of ""what if the Nazis won ww2"" actually did occur and we are living in it.

Look at today, we've got eugenics normalized so much that it is taught in every school at every age. ""We are just upgradable machines"". Genetic optimization is ""just science"".

118,17ay06i,2023-10-18,conspiracy,Israeli Culpability for the Cycle of Violence,"I know this is not something Israeli apologists want to hear and I also know that groups like Hamas have been responsible for terrible things such as what happened on Oct 7, 2023 which I condemn strongly but we must zoom out and look at the bigger picture. We must add context to the present conflict.

&#x200B;

It might seem ""obvious"" that the present conflict was ""started by Hamas"" according to Israeli apologists. This line of thinking is narrow-minded and doesn't look at the larger scale and scope of things. Whether its the present conflict between Israel & Palestine or the other conflicts of the past since at least 1947-48, Israel is ultimately at fault for the cycle of violence for the following reasons:

&#x200B;

1. Israel is the one that created Hamas in the first place. They financed it and gave rise to it to divide and conquer the Palestinians. Despite warnings of blowback, they continued with their divide and conquer op. So ultimately, what Hamas does is on Israel.

2. Israel's occupation of land that is internationally recognized as Palestinian land aka East Jerusalem & the West Bank is a major reason for why the cycle of violence continues. Everyone condemns Russia's occupation of Ukrainian territory especially in the West but not enough wish to do the same when it comes to Israeli occupation of Palestinian territory

3. Israel's blockade of Gaza which has been ongoing since 2005 aka 18 years has turned Gaza into the largest open air, concentration camp in the world and is a pivotal reason for why militant groups from Gaza continue to attack Israel. The Israeli blockade is a clear violation of international and human rights laws. It is a clear example of collective punishment. Ask yourself this, if the government or another major power tried to trap you in an enclosed space, restricting your rights/freedoms, mobility, etc what would you do? Would you not resist?

4. Despite not blockading the West Bank in the same way they have done for Gaza, they have built walls dividing Palestinian communities, they have put checkpoints in place restricting mobility, they constantly harass, search, arrest, injure, kill, beat & raid Palestinian residents of the West Bank, they constantly spy on the Palestinians, they infiltrate them, they have subjected them to apartheid like conditions, they have violated the rights/freedoms of the Palestinians, they have slowly taken over the West Bank, illegal settlement at a time and they have been doing this for decades.

5. Hamas isn't just a militant group. They are the government of Gaza. They actually beat the US supported Fatah in an election in 2006 and came to power this way. Due to a number of reasons, including Israeli interference with Palestinian unity, the blockade, etc, an election has not been held since. The reason why western & Israeli press say Hamas came to power via a violent takeover is b/c of the war they fought with Fatah in 2007 who was, traditionally speaking, the leader of the Palestinian ppl. This has slowly changed as they are losing support and are being called out as Israel's/the US' useful idiots. The reason why Hamas pre-emptivelty took over the Gaza Strip is because they got wind of a joint US/Israeli/Fatah/UK coup attempt to remove Hamas after they won the 2006 election. Perhaps, if no such coup attempt was in the works, a unity agreement could have been worked out

6. Former White House Communications Director, Pat Bucanan, famously said in 2009 during the Israel-Hamas conflict of that year, ""The brothers of the little girls killed in Israeli airstrikes will grow up and join Hamas to fight Israel"". Israeli aggression has been ongoing for decades and its what breeds resistance and radicalization. Indiscriminate Israeli bombings in Gaza which mostly kill innocent civilians is one of the reasons why certain Palestinians become radicalized and go on to attack Israeli civilians

7. Even the UN, in a report released in 2021, lays the blame upon Israel for this cycle of violence that has continued for decades
8. The US is a major funder/chief enabler of Israel. They provide them with billions in unconditional military/financial aid every year. It is this money and these weapons that are then used by Israel to kill Palestinians. Therefore, the US shares a large amount of the blame as well. Technically, the US & the EU fund both sides of the conflict as they provide hundreds of millions through UNRWA to the Palestinians which goes toward much needed supplies such as medical equipment but is also used by Hamas to fund the procurement & production of their weapons

9. In the months before the attack and even a few days before, Israeli settlers, police & the military stormed/raided the third holiest site of Islam, the Al Aqsa Masjid. This has been increasing in frequency especially after the ultra-nationalist and ultra-orthodox coalition led by Netanyahu came to power. Certain radical Israelis wish to eventually destroy the Al Aqsa Masjid & build the Third Temple.

10. Violent Israeli settler attacks upon Palestinians has increased and are far more frequent since the Netanyahu led coalition has come to power as well. Such attacks have been ongoing for decades. This has caused an increase of violent attacks perpetrated by Palestinians against Israelis.

11. Violent raids have also increased under said government that target Palestinian refugee camps and communities including the controversial attacks/raids upon Shiekh Jarrah, a Palestinian community in East Jerusalem

12. If we are going to focus upon the Oct 7, 2023 attack on Israel, know that there is a lot of suspicious aspects associated with the official story that I go into detail in another post and it may very well be a false flag and/or a case of foreknowledge. Even if we believe the official story, this would be the biggest intel failure since 9/11 which itself was most likley an inside job. This is why a lot of Israelis are angry at Netanyahu, his coalition and Israeli intel/the military

13. The Nakba aka the massive displacement of Palestinian residents took place between 1947-49. Even today, Palestinians are internally displaced due to Israeli bombardments. Furthermore, Israel will not honour the Palestinian's right of return. Let us hope that any humanitarian corridors set up b/c of the latest Israeli bombardment of Gaza is not used to push Gazans out and then disallow them from returning

14. With suppport from the US, rather than come to the table and negotiate a permanent, two state, peaceful solution, Israel continues its aggression with the intent of slowly eradicating the Palestinian state while eventually claiming it in its entirety for itself. This has been their goal all along. This is why no peaceful solution has come about all this time. This is why Netanyahu held up a map at the 2023 UN General Assembly a few months before the attack without Palestine listed. This is why Golda Meir, the former Israeli prime minister, said, ""There was no such thing as Palestinians"" in 1969 and why Israel's Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, repeated this in March 2023

15. With regards to the recent attack upon the hospital in Gaza that killed hundreds of Palestinians, even if it was a misfired Palestinian rocket, which is refutable, an argument can easily be made that points the finger at Israel. I am going beyond the theory that it was an Israeli airstrike or an Israeli interception or Israel using rockets similar to the ones used by Hamas/PIJ to place the blame on them, or an Israeli hacking of Palestinian rocket systems. I am suggesting that this would not have happened regardless of whose to blame directly if it wasn't for all of the aforementioned points I've stated thus far. Plus, the only reason why the courtyard of the hospital was full of hundreds upon hundreds of people in the first place was because they were seeking refuge there from constant Israeli airstrikes and due to the Israeli evacuation order of North Gaza. If it wasn't for the climate of aggression and violence established over the years by Israeli actions, none of this would most likely be happening today

&#x200B;

Beyond Israel and the US, we can also lay blame at the door of the Military Industrial Complex and other influential, globalist entities for the perpetuation of this conflict such as lobbyists, US think tanks, NGOs involved in regime change/war, etc. In addition to perpetuating this conflict, profiting off of it & gaining more power, they will also use this conflict to distract us and divide us even further

What happened to Israel on Oct 7, 2023, while being a terrible tragedy, is rare for Israel but is the norm for Palestine. This is something they face far too often due to Israeli aggression and that is something Israeli apologists just can't wrap their minds around

Hatred is born through violence and vice versa. It is fueled by media and government propaganda. This is why many are condemning an entire enclave of 2.3 million ppl, 50% of whom are children and most of whom are innocent civilians to death. Where is the humanity?

How this crap actually “works”.,"The hypocrisy is mind bending. We’ve witnessed the most dubious and shrill accusations of everyone’s “human rights violations”. Various NGOs exist which serve to decry a governments legitimacy based on human rights. And like zombies, the American public shout down any government which is in violation of human rights, I.e. Saddam, Putin, Kim Jong, etc. like a legacy of evil dictators. Yet along comes Israel with it’s carpet bombing campaign of Gaza (this isn’t the first time for you young uns.) Israel used to bomb the crap out of Gaza all the time. Human rights violations not with standing, and everyone in the government just wrings their hands and says “fuck it”. 

(So if you’re a leftist and you believe in Palestine, Joe Biden is not your friend. In fact that always been the problem with the democrats, they hate Palestine. People used to care about this.)

Offically, the UN decries human rights abuses and that means sanctions or something serious if you are Somalia, Iraq, or Lybia, or any other country with mostly brown skinned people. If the New York Times calls you out as humans rights abuser, expect Uncle Sam to come over and kick your ass. Unless you’re Israel. If you are, expect hand wringing, and weird excuses that they expect you to understand but really don’t make sense. 

However I would like to point out that Ilhan Omar and AOC hate Palestine, while waving the Palestinian flag. They are false friends (like the opposite of false flag). The left pretends to hate Israel, yet we are supplying them with Armageddon level weaponry right now. Good job Biden. This is the same shit we lived through in the 90s and the 2000s.

120,175fzjh,2023-10-11,conspiracy,Isreali-Palestine/Gaza Conflict and WW3," This recent Isreal-Gaza conflict started after a surprise missile attack on Oct. 7th on Saturday morning by the Hamas military the attack was named the ""al-Aqsa Flood"" by one Hamas Leader. The reason given for its timing is Israel allowing ""Jewish groups to desecrate al-Aqsa Mosque”.

Recently, the Israeli government has begun to support extremist Jewish groups attacking and expelling Muslims and Christians from their holy sites.

Jewish groups like the Temple Institute believe it is necessary to build the third temple on the site of the Aqsa mosque to bring about the Jewish messiah, some Christians believe this will be the antichrist.

So this Isreal-Gaza conflict is viewed ideologically as an extension of the isreal-palestine conflict which has been going on for awhile, and is centered around Jerusalem and the conflict surrounding the holy sites there and both the Jewish and Arab states want control of it, that's why Jerusalem is a special international zone, the original plan in 1947 was to establish the Jewish state, and to give the Arab state its independence.

The Temple in Jerusalem (Muslims would refer to it as a Mosque) they call the Haram el Sharif or ""“the Sacred Noble Sanctuary"" that is important to them, and The Dome of the Rock constructed in 692AD is the place where Mohammad supposedly ascended into heaven, that rock is the same place Christians/Jews believe Abraham offered Isaac and the location of the Holy of Holies in the Jewish temple. So the Temple mount is the center of controversy, there is a Muslim area and Jewish area, Jews pray at the Western Wall (Wailing wall) which is part of the structure of the Temple mount from the time of the Second temple. This 35 acre property is bound to be involved in this latest conflict as Jews contend that the New temple should be erected there, when the new temple is built that is a sign of that they are prepared for a new messiah. This holy site is also where the Muslim Mahdi appears, Muhammad ibn Izzat and Muhammd ‘Arif comment on the above tradition:

The Mahdi will be victorious and eradicate those pigs and dogs and the idols of this time so that there will once more be a caliphate based on prophethood as the hadith states… Jerusalem will be the location of the rightly guided caliphate and the center of Islamic rule, which will be headed by Imam al-Mahdi…

Islamic tradition pictures the Mahdi as joining with the army of Muslim warriors carrying black flags. The Mahdi will then lead this army to Israel and re-conquer it for Islam.

They believe Jerusalem will become the location of the Mahdi’s rule over the Earth. Rasulullah \[Muhammad\] said: ""Armies carrying black flags will come from Khurasan. No power will be able to stop them and they will finally reach Eela (Baitul Maqdas in Jerusalem) where they will erect their flags.""

Joel Richardson believes the Muslim Madhi is the Christian Anti-Christ 

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9ZqaELMTZA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9ZqaELMTZA)

Baitul Maqdas in Arabic this means “the holy house” This is referring to the Dome of the Rock Mosque and is located on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem.

All of the worlds religions predict the end times surrounding this area.  

Read Zacharia 14 the 2nd coming of Christ, 2 Thessalonians 2 - Antichrist & abomination that causes desolation, Matthew 24

In context to the geopolitical atmosphere around the Israel Palestine conflict this is bound to result in WW3. It would appear that all of the worlds religions in some ideological conflict., even the Illuminati also has their hands in the mix, as  it fits in nicely with their agenda for a New World Order Albert Pike a grandmaster Freemason in the 1871 described the 3rd World War in his book Morals and Dogmas. The 3rd world war begins first by slowly weaking the nations with communism and setup a proxy war between Christians, Jews, and Islam with the atheistic communities secretly guiding the war that would exhaust the nations into accepting a one-world system of the Luciferian agenda.

&#x200B;

Hamas is responsible for the attack on Israel it is important not to conflate all Palestinians as being a part of this retaliation but it is important to recognize there is an inescapable religious conflict taking place here and the question of co-existence is vital to this saturation.  Let's examine the demographics of Israel-

The population of Muslim & Jewish is about 50/50 what will be the consequence of Israel going in with a full-scale ground invasion on Gaza and completely leveling the territory, I think the result of this will lead to more an increase in political and religious division among the population of Israel.   The question is, is this escapable?  Is diplomacy a solution in this situation?  I am curious to know what your opinions are and what solution you would suggest for this small region of the world.

Creating the Enemies We Now Fight Against  


We've extensively documented that the U.S. and Israel created Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups in an attempt to fight other enemies.  
Larry Johnson - a counterterrorism official at the U.S. State Department - says:  


The Israelis are their own worst enemies when it comes to fighting terrorism. They are like a guy who sets fire to his hair and then tries to put it out by hitting it with a hammer. They do more to incite and sustain terrorism than curb it.  


As one example, Israel helped create Hamas.  


Veteran journalist Robert Dreyfuss writes: In the decades before 9/11, hard-core activists and organizations among Muslim fundamentalists on the far right were often viewed as allies for two reasons, because they were seen a fierce anti-communists and because the opposed secular nationalists such as Egypt's Gamal Abdel Nasser, Iran's Mohammed Mossadegh.  


\*\*\*  


In Syria, the United States, Israel, and Jordan supported the Muslim Brotherhood in a civil war against Syria. And ... Israel quietly backed Ahmed Yassin and the Muslim Brotherhood in the West Bank and Gaza, leading to the establishment of Hamas.  


See this and this:  


According to former U.S. Ambassador to Saudi Arabia Charles Freeman, Shin Bet - the Israeli counter-intelligence and internal security service - knowingly created Hamas:  


Israel started Hamas. It was a project of Shin Bet, which had a feeling that they could use it to hem in the PLO.  


Anti War reported in 2006:  


Amid all the howls of pain and gnashing of teeth over the triumph of Hamas in the Palestinian elections, one fact remains relatively obscure, albeit highly relevant: Israel did much to launch Hamas as an effective force in the occupied territories. If ever there was a clear case of ""blowback,"" then this is it. As Richard Sale pointed out in a piece for UPI:  


""Israel and Hamas may currently be locked in deadly combat, but, according to several current and former U.S. intelligence officials, beginning in the late 1970s, Tel Aviv gave direct and indirect financial aid to Hamas over a period of years. Israel 'aided Hamas directly - the Israelis wanted to use it as a counterbalance to the PLO (Palestinian Liberation Organization),' said Tony Cordesman, Middle East analyst for the Center for Strategic \[and International\] Studies.Israel's support for Hamas 'was a direct attempt to divide and dilute support for a strong, secular PLO by using a competing religious alternative,' said a former senior CIA official.""  


Middle East analyst Ray Hanania concurs:  


""In addition to hoping to turn the Palestinian masses away from Arafat and the PLO, the Likud leadership believed they could achieve a workable alliance with Islamic, anti-Arafat forces that would also extend Israel's control over the occupied territories.""  


In a conscious effort to undermine the Palestine Liberation Organization and the leadership of Yasser Arafat, in 1978 the government of then-Prime Minister Menachem Begin approved the application of Sheik Ahmad Yassin to start a ""humanitarian"" organization known as the Islamic Association, or Mujama. The roots of this Islamist group were in the fundamentalist Muslim Brotherhood, and this was the seed that eventually grew into Hamas - but not before it was amply fertilized and nurtured with Israeli funding and political support.  


Begin and his successor, Yitzhak Shamir, launched an effort to undercut the PLO, creating the so-called Village Leagues, composed of local councils of handpicked Palestinians who were willing to collaborate with Israel - and, in return, were put on the Israeli payroll. Sheik Yassin and his followers soon became a force within the Village Leagues. This tactical alliance between Yassin and the Israelis was based on a shared antipathy to the militantly secular and leftist PLO: the Israelis allowed Yassin's group to publish a newspaper and set up an extensive network of charitable organizations, which collected funds not only from the Israelis but also from Arab states opposed to Arafat.  


Ami Isseroff, writing on MideastWeb, shows how the Israelis deliberately promoted the Islamists of the future Hamas by helping them turn the Islamic University of Gaza into a base from which the group recruited activists - and the suicide bombers of tomorrow. As the only higher-education facility in the Gaza strip, and the only such institution open to Palestinians since Anwar Sadat closed Egyptian colleges to them, IUG contained within its grounds the seeds of the future Palestinian state...

123,1773q35,2023-10-13,conspiracy,A New Nakba aka Mass Exodus,"The Israeli regime has just ordered more than 1 million Gazans to flee Northern Gaza and into the Southern portion of Gaza.

Gaza is already one of the most densely populated places on the planet packed with 2.3+ million ppl into 141 sq mi half of whom are children.

Now they want almost half the population of Gaza to squeeze into just the southern part of Gaza and out of Gaza's capital city, Gaza city, in with the rest of Gaza's population in the south thus creating an even more densely populated enclave.

Eventually, while packed into a tighter space, the Israelis can push forward with less resistance and corner/trap them in Southern Gaza as well, just like they're doing right now for the whole of Gaza which will force them to eventually flee through Egypt.

This is most likley the big picture-

They are going to launch a ground invasion of Gaza and they wish for as many Gazans to flee as possible not because they care about civilian casualties but b/c they don't want to deal with the resistance that a hostile population will put up once they do enter. They want their invasion to go as smoothly as it can. 

Eventually, their goal is to occupy and fully takeover Gaza after overthrowing Hamas with the goal of eventually annexing Gaza either officially like they did with East Jerusalem or unofficially/quietly like they've done with the West Bank. 

They could always transfer control to the Fatah led so called government in the West Bank but would they after spilling so much blood in Gaza? Probably not. Even if they did, Israel would remain the masters just like they are in the West Bank with the transfer over to Fatah only being stagecraft. 

They will keep pushing the Gaza population back until they are forced to exit through Egypt.

By pushing Gaza's population into a smaller space, they are making them easier to target, spy on and attack. 

Once inside Gaza, they could even put the blame upon Hamas/PIJ for massacres of civilians by suggesting that Hamas killed them for trying to flee or come up with other excuses. 

This is the real goal of any humanitarian corridors and the all out siege. Create dire conditions, displace the native population, force the native population to flee and take it over completely. 

They will then rebuild the area and fill the void with Israeli settlers as they have been doing for years in the West Bank/East Jerusalem. 

The remaining Gazans that don't get killed or flee will simply be placed under the control/jurisdiction of Israel via the Fatah or Israel itself similar to Palestinians in the West Bank.

Therefore, the end result is a new Nakba last seen in 1947/48. Gazans flee and can't return. The last piece of Palestine not yet under the control of Israel aka Gaza is taken over and the Palestinian state disappears. 

This is why Netanyahu held up a map at the UN general assembly a few months before the attack with no Palestine visible.

This is why Israel’s Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said that there is no Palestine.

This is why the false flag that is the so called Hamas attack had to happen.

They get to do all of this with US protection and the international community will do nothing.

The global stage whispers of neo-fascism, echoing a past that once brought the world to its knees, and we are the silent witnesses to the unfolding drama.**

**NATO/AUKUS/ALLIES vs OPEC+/BRICS/AXIS**  
The strategic chessboard of global politics is witnessing a realignment of powers; and although the Allies and Axis may be named aside the respective pairs; their true identity should be up for you to decide. The NATO/AUKUS bloc represents the traditional Western hegemony, which seems to be in a silent battle for supremacy and influence against the OPEC+/BRICS group. This latter group is not just about oil; it's about a new world order challenging Western dominance. The use of proxy forces, particularly by Iran, has become a significant factor in this complex equation. Iran's network of proxies across the Middle East, often referred to as the ""Shiite Crescent,"" stretches from Yemen through Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon, down to the Gaza Strip, challenging local and neighboring governments and adding a volatile element to the power struggle.

**The Israel-Palestine Conflict**  
The enduring conflict between Israel and Palestine is more than a territorial dispute; it's a stark representation of the ""Us vs Them"" narrative. The ethnic cleansing and the vivid contrast between the lighter-skinned Israelis and the darker-skinned Palestinians echo the darkest chapters of human history, reminiscent of the racial ideologies that fueled the Beer Hall Putsch and the subsequent rise of Nazi Germany. Iran's support for Palestinian groups like Hamas, and its condemnation of Israeli actions, further complicate the situation, as does the involvement of Iranian proxies like Hezbollah, which has been leading attacks on Israel, siding with Hamas.

**The Socioeconomic Divide**  
The global housing market crisis and the surge in immigration are fueling a divide. As the cost of living skyrockets, the influx of immigrants is perceived by some as exacerbating the problem, further entrenching the nationalism that's creeping into neo-fascism. This is not just about economic survival; it's about maintaining cultural and racial 'purity,' a dangerous echo of the past.

**Oil Politics: U.S. and Saudi Arabia**  
The recent oil policy negotiations between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia, where Saudi Arabia has delayed commitments, reflect the shifting sands of oil diplomacy. The West's desire to disrupt the OPEC+ alliance and BRICS from achieving their Agenda 2030 goals is evident, as they seek to retain the power that's slipping from their grasp daily. The proxy wars in the Middle East, particularly Iran's support for militias that oppose U.S. interests, are a crucial part of this dynamic. The United States, with a vested interest in Israel and the Middle East, aims to maintain a solid nuclear presence in the region, mirroring the BRICS nations' support through Iran. This allows both the NATO/AUKUS and OPEC+/BRICS blocs to continue their agendas, with the destabilization of the Middle East serving as a strategic advantage for controlling resources, particularly oil.

**BRICS and Africa**  
The adoption of BRICS nations in Africa is not without controversy. It represents a significant shift in alliances and economic dependencies. This move could be a game-changer in the global power dynamics, with African nations potentially playing a pivotal role in the BRICS' challenge to Western economic dominance. The involvement of proxy forces in these regions, while not as pronounced as in the Middle East, could become a factor as global powers vie for influence and access to resources.

**Echoes of Nazi Germany**  
The parallels with Nazi Germany are chilling. The nationalism and fascism that are slowly infiltrating Western societies under the guise of security and prosperity are alarmingly similar to the early days of the Third Reich. The world is on a precipice, and the lessons of history have never been more relevant.

**The Global Dance: Globalism's Subtle Influence**  
Amidst the loud proclamations of nationalism, the subtle rhythm of globalism persists. It's a reminder that, despite the resurgence of borders and barriers, the world remains inextricably linked by economic and cultural ties that transcend nationalistic agendas.

**The Consumerist Facade: A Mechanism of Distraction**  
The global economy's reliance on consumerism is a masterful illusion, a distraction that keeps the populace focused on material pursuits while their liberties are quietly curtailed. It's a page from a playbook that seems to repeat throughout history, promising progress while perpetuating control.

**Project Blue Beam: A Metaphor for Manipulation**  
The conspiracy theory of Project Blue Beam, with its narrative of a fabricated unifying threat, is a metaphor for the manipulation of public perception. It's a stark reminder of the power of narrative and the lengths to which it can be used to control and unify populations under a common cause.

**The Peril of Silence and the Cost of Speaking Out**  
In Australia, the legislative shift to allow authorities to add, edit, or delete information—both digital and physical—without the safeguard of a warrant, is a stark reminder of the fragility of our freedoms. It's a move that resonates with the oppressive tactics of a bygone era, where the state wielded unchecked power to shape reality and silence dissent.

Protesting and speaking out, once the hallmarks of a vibrant democracy, are now acts laden with risk. The media, a battleground of narratives, often serves as a tool for those in power to shape the discourse, leaving little room for dissenting voices. The debates over masks and vaccines have revealed the extent to which control can be exerted in the name of public safety. The Orwellian overtones are unmistakable, as the right to speak becomes increasingly perilous, and the act of silence becomes complicit in the erosion of freedoms.

**So, don't speak up. Don't protest. Don't challenge the creeping tendrils of control that strangle our liberties.** *It's not worth it, they say. There is no hope against the globalist agenda, underpinned by neo-fascism and nationalism. Accept the somber reality: the world is changing, not by our own hands, but by those who have long studied the art of manipulation. In this new age, the call for peace is a silent one, a subdued whisper to not cause a stir, to not oppose, to not be. For in this silence, the subtle yet profound truth is revealed: it is not the loud but the quiet who will awaken, not the passive but the introspective who will act. And in this realization, we find not despair, but the ember of change that, once kindled, can set the world alight.*",PsychiatricCliq,t2_3nqy64sq,0.61,4,3

My theory is simple.  I believe western governments do not actually support Israel.  Israel has had close ties with the west for many years both militarily and economically, so it would be 'weak' for the West to not support them.  The reality is though, the west can no longer fight major wars, or act as a 'world police'.  So why are they showing support when they actually don't?  I believe western governments have instructed state media to slowly paint an anti Israeli narrative(Even pro war channels such as CNN are slowly turning anti Israel), this way, the people of western nations feel like they have collectively decided against Israel, which enhances their illusion of free will.  Western governments will eventually abandon Israel, which will be seemingly be in favor of the people, when they actually never planned to help Israel in the first place.

139,17oiz8g,2023-11-05,conspiracy,Dipshit Secrets of our Rotten World: The fake Israel-Hamas outrage sweeping elite universities,"TL;DR: As part of the world’s largest conspiracy, our most elite – [and most criminal](https://theponzipapers.substack.com/p/crime-school-summary) – universities have used the Israel-Hamas War to trick us into thinking we must all be angry, divided warmongers while they undermine campus protests to keep us from uniting against endless war.

&#x200B;

If you haven’t yet seen [this booklet](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/173sshz/dipshit_secrets_of_our_rotten_world_after_peter/) alleging the wildest totalitarian conspiracy imaginable, I recommend it. 

The bad news: We’ve been taken over by dipshit supervillains who brainwashed themselves into thinking it was a good idea to poison all of media, culture, and education for decades so they could do a multi-trillion-dollar Ponzi scheme, which is about to send the world economy off the biggest cliff in history. 

The good news: We have the stupidest form of government in world history and we’re about to discover the entire economy is a lie, so we’re about to mock it mercilessly and abolish it. 

See this [summary](https://theponzipapers.substack.com/p/dipshit-secrets-of-our-rotten-world) that points to key evidence or follow my post history for proof of every word, along with a host of other rotten secrets that didn’t fit in the booklet.

\--

In our [last installment](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/17klssv/dipshit_secrets_of_our_rotten_world_reddits_role/), we learned just how criminal Reddit is: In order to serve the criminal interests of their supervillain owners, Reddit uses troll armies to make us bitter, divisive, misinformed, and hopeless. They coordinate enough action to get us think that we *must* be divided, that we are *supposed* to be divided, that we *can’t* collectively solve any of our problems, since that’s what we see all over social media.

This is, of course, gaslighting. They tell us we’re in hellworld, they make certain that it’s true, and they bleed us dry. 

Central to this is a constant effort to divide the populace: The biggest threat to a secret kleptocracy – which is a fancy name for when con artists take over the government – is a united movement against it, and they know this. So, they’ve sliced us into tribes and bubbles, giving each of us a slice of truth and whole lot of bullshit (an [actual criminal propaganda technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Bullshit) developed at Princeton) that makes us angry at the other tribes instead of the supervillains orchestrating the entire show. 

Reddit is just one vehicle that’s been used for this, but we have countless others:

* News media slicing us into angry political tribes, knowing full well that both parties are in on the con. 
* Daytime television telling us we’re awash in moral decay – that the viewers are the *good* Americans, but that we’re surrounded by young hoodlums, addicts, Satanists, you name it.
* Reality TV has it right in the name: They show us endless hedonism, materialism, and strife, and they call it reality.
* Popular films and TV tell us only superheroes can save the world from evil while they scoff at the idea of collective action, painting the “masses” as helpless minions who can do nothing but gape at a world shaped by more powerful people.

\--

If you’re wondering how *any* of the booklet’s claims can be proven, it’s through repetition: When we see something suspicious, we might just have a hunch. But if we see a network of people all doing the same suspicious things, we get our proof. For instance, if we find a fantastical science start-up that looks like it’s faking evidence, we *might* have a Ponzi scheme. If it’s funded by a university that invests in dozens of fantastical science start-ups that look like they’re faking evidence, we have proof of a Ponzi factory. 

Let’s see some of that repetition in action: Our elite universities, all awash with crypto billionaires and Ponzi schemes, are all manufacturing partisan division around the Israel-Hamas War.

* **Harvard University** has erupted in controversy after student groups signed a statement saying they “[hold the Israeli regime *entirely* responsible for all unfolding violence.](https://www.businessinsider.com/harvard-university-israel-hamas-what-happened-students-palestine-2023-10)”
* A professor at **Stanford University** has been firing after [downplaying the Holocaust](https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/13/us/stanford-instructor-jewish-holocaust-comments-reaj/index.html), calling Jewish students colonizers, and making them stand in a corner.
* The president of the **New York University** Student Bar Association said [that Israel bears full responsibility for all deaths](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/opinion/nyu-law-student-who-defended-hamas-terror-attack-refuses-to-say-if-she-has-empathy-for-brutalized-israelis/ar-AA1iUAmo), that she wouldn’t condemn Palestine’s attacks, and that she wouldn’t say she has empathy for any Israeli victims.
* A self-identified “radical Muslim” **Yale University** professor celebrated the Hamas attacks in the name of armed struggle and solidarity, calling the initial attacks an “[extraordinary day](https://nypost.com/2023/10/12/radical-yale-professor-faces-calls-to-be-fired-over-comments-on-hamas-attacks/).”
* A **Columbia University** professor called Hamas’ attacks, [“awesome,” “astounding,” “incredible,” and a “stunning victory.”](https://www.businessinsider.com/columbia-professor-faces-removal-petition-after-pro-hamas-attack-article-2023-10)
* A **Cornell University** professor did similarly, calling Hamas’ attacks [“exhilarating” and “energizing.”](https://nypost.com/2023/10/16/russell-rickford-says-hamas-terror-was-exhilarating-exciting/)
* At **University of Pennsylvania**, [student protests erupted](https://www.inquirer.com/education/university-of-pennsylvania-liz-magill-palestinian-walkout-antisemitism-20231016.html) after the university president condemned Hamas without mentioning Palestinian deaths in Gaza.

It’s reasonable to address Israel’s role of oppression of the Palestinian people – it’s unreasonable to celebrate Hamas’ terror attacks, which will only send more Palestinians to the slaughter.  And yet, *all* these schools, all related to one another via a network of the country’s wealthiest and most powerful people, *all* had students or professors take wildly incendiary, divisive, and unreasonable stances on the Israel-Hamas War.

\-- 

The initial stories are just the beginning of this entirely concocted news. Afterward, we see a host of billionaire donors publicly express their outrage: 

* The Wexner Foundation [expressed their revulsion](https://www.bostonherald.com/2023/10/16/harvard-suffers-major-loss-as-stunned-wexner-foundation-pulls-support/), pledging to withdraw over $2 million in funding for Harvard. While that article calls the foundation “a leading voice for the Jewish faith,” they make no mention of billionaire Les Wexner’s incredibly close ties to Jeffrey Epstein (who ran a Ponzi factory at Harvard): The Lolita Express and Epstein’s Manhattan townhouse had belonged to Wexner, and Epstein had Wexner’s power of attorney. They are, quite literally, [partners in crime](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2021/06/inside-jeffrey-epsteins-decades-long-relationship-with-his-biggest-client).
* Marc Rowan, CEO of Apollo Global Management was one of several major donors to [withdraw their](https://www.businessinsider.com/upenn-leaders-condemn-hamas-israel-terror-attacks-after-donor-backlash-2023-10) support for University of Pennsylvania in response to the protests. Here, we find another Epstein connection: [Apollo Global paid Epstein $158 million](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/25/apollos-leon-black-to-retire-as-ceo-but-remain-chairman-after-he-is-cleared-in-internal-epstein-probe.html) for “financial advice” (or investment in Ponzi schemes, of course).
* Hedge fund billionaire Bill Ackman has demanded that [Harvard name the students](https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/11/business/harvard-israel-hamas-ceos-students/index.html) who expressed support for Hamas. Entirely related, Ackman has expressed support for [cryptocurrency](https://www.forbes.com/sites/rosemariemiller/2022/11/21/crypto-is-here-to-stay-says-billionaire-hedge-fund-manager-ackman/).
* Israeli Billionaire Idan Ofer [resigned from Harvard’s board](https://nypost.com/2023/10/12/israeli-billionaire-idan-ofer-quits-harvard-board-in-protest-of-student-letter/) in protest. Notably, [Ofer co-founded a think tank with Richard Branson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idan_Ofer). Branson, as I’ve discussed, [has made a career running Ponzi schemes](https://theponzipapers.substack.com/p/part-ii-the-birth-of-a-brand-new), and was one of the earliest investors in the crypto Ponzi via Clinkle. 

\--

These manufactured crises serve several purposes. First, they undermine reasonable critiques of Israel: If someone challenges Israel’s hawkish stance, now they’re lumped in with people who downplayed the Holocaust and called Hamas’ terror attacks, “awesome.”

Second, they piss everybody off one way or another. Remember, a secret kleptocracy is essentially a cult with state power: Just as cult leaders do, they want to divide their members against one another. And since unified college protests are one of the most powerful tools the public has for dismantling a secret kleptocracy, these criminals want to make sure to divide campuses.

Third, with all the billionaires weighing in, they want to convey that the smartest, most successful people wouldn’t dare criticize Israel.

Fourth, we have some Ponzi scheme [kayfabe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kayfabe): Because these schools and billionaires are flooded with Ponzi schemes, they have much less money than they say they do (because they already stole it out of their own funds). They’ll justify some of these budgetary issues by pointing to the billionaires who “withdrew their support.”

Fifth, they tee up attacks on higher education with op-eds like, “[Pro-Hamas protests show higher education has crossed the line.](https://nypost.com/2023/10/15/pro-hamas-protests-show-higher-education-has-crossed-the-line/)” They point to these events, which they manufactured, to decry the woke agenda and cultural Marxism, all to influence society into accepting the slow dismantling of liberal arts and social sciences. 

It’s no coincidence that our last Secretary of Education, [Betsy DeVos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betsy_DeVos), is a pyramid scheme heiress who invested in the crypto Ponzi via Theranos: Our leadership is intentionally dismantling education so they can try to make us too stupid to realize we’re being conned.

142,17cj4dp,2023-10-20,conspiracy,Israel's Genocide of Gaza,"In only 13 days of fighting (Oct 7-20, 2023) Israel has killed an est. 4,137+ and injured 13,300+ Gazans. This does not include the Hamas fighters who were killed in Israel which I wont include for obvious reasons. These numbers are constantly changing as every few minutes there are new hospital admissions and many are still being dug up from under the rubble. Although we don't have a clear enough picture on how many of these are combatants, indications suggest that the overwhelming vast majority are civilians as is the case for most Israeli bombing campaigns in Gaza.

Of the 4,000+ killed Gazans, more than 50% are children

They have also killed 81+ and injured a further 300+ in the West Bank

This is an estimated, grand total of almost 18,000 Palestinians in less than two weeks

This is by far the deadliest military campaign by Israel against Gaza to date.

What is happening in Gaza is nothing short of a genocide, a massacre

Israel has done all of this even before the start of a ground invasion of Gaza

To put this into perspective, Russia has been waging a war in Ukraine for almost 1.8 years now. In that time, the OHCHR has confirmed that between Feb 22, 2022 and Sept 10, 2023, 9,614 civilians have been killed and a further 17,535 more have been injured. This is a total of more than 27,000 civilians.  They have cautioned that the actual number is higher.

Even if you were to look at some of the much higher estimates issued by for example the C.D. Howe Institute, based in NATO member, Canada, who receives funding, in part, from General Dynamics, whose weapons are being sent to Ukraine by the US, they suggest that 40,000 civilians have been killed while a further 50,000 have been injured in the Russian war upon Ukraine which would put the total at 90,000. This would be just dreadful if true.

The lower end estimate of 26,000-27,000 from the UN suggests that about 1,350 civilians are dying or being injured in Ukraine every MONTH. This is terrible all on its own.

The higher estimate suggests that about 4,500 civilians are being injured or killed in Ukraine per MONTH. This is absolutely awful.

However, in the case of Palestine, judging by current numbers and the ever increasing intensification of Israel's bombardment of Gaza, the worst ever to be unleashed upon the enclave, we can estimate that almost 1,400 Palestinians are being killed or injured every DAY. This is only the number of dead or injured directly attributable to Israel's constant bombings and nothing else such as the impact of the siege, psychological trauma, etc. Plus, it doesn't take into consideration that the aforementioned stats are most likley a low ball estimate. This is INSANE.

To make matters worse, Israel has put into place a complete siege of Gaza, worse than its 18+ year blockade of the enclave. This means no water, food, medicine, internet, electricity, etc is allowed. Essentially, 2.3 million ppl of which 50% are children are trapped in the largest, open air prison in the world with nowhere to go and are sitting ducks to constant Israeli airstrikes with no aid.

At first I thought perhaps, there is no one pulling the strings- but rather its the views and fast changing values of society that is causing the change.

So clearly the right and wrong this must come from an extrinsic source- and this source must be something that most leaders subscribe to.

How could the Cubans have acquired this information? The answer might lie in the 2022 JFK assassination files – a covert C.I.A. officer and engineer with a “Q” level clearance that was captured in Cuba in late 1960. His name was **David L. Christ**, but his backstopped cover name was **Daniel Carswell**.

In 1957, Christ was granted a “Q” level clearance with the Atomic Energy Commission to “participate in a joint TSS-OSI project”. There is a high probability that that this “project” (under the cover of Audio Security) was to provide the Israelis with nuclear weapons. A protégé of Christ was none other than **James McCord**, who was also an Audio Security expert that was granted a “Q” clearance in July 1962, shortly before heading to West Germany for a two-year TDY. McCord, of course, was also one of Watergate Plumbers who was arrested during the burglary. Why was McCord selected for Watergate?

Most of the Highly Enriched Uranium that was diverted to the Israelis is believed to have come from the NUMEC plant in Apollo, Pennsylvania – which was the source of fuel for the Westinghouse Astro Nuclear Laboratory contract for the NERVA / Project Rover nuclear rocket engine under purchase order 59-NP-12674.

**Background**

The Eisenhower Administration in the early 1950s was pushing hard for changes to the Atomic Energy Act to allow the forward deployment of free-fall nuclear weapons in West Germany and Italy to counter the growing threat from the Soviets. As part of the “Atoms for Peace” program, Eisenhower wanted ""*a program to encourage widespread participation in the development and utilization of atomic energy for peaceful purposes to the maximum extent consistent with the common defense and security and with the health and safety of the public*."" In the 1950s and 1960s, some NATO allies, notably West Germany and Italy, were remarkably compliant to U.S. wishes regarding the storage of nuclear weapons on their soil. At the time, State Department officials believed that as long as the U.S. was seeking to store nuclear weapons in Europe and to obtain “*the use rights which we require*,” it “*must be prepared to pay some* *price*.” Part of the price that Washington decided to pay was to develop arrangements that have been in place for decades: training NATO allies to use nuclear weapons delivery systems and making available nuclear weapons for use by alliance forces in the event of war. One of the chief negotiators of this arrangement was the Secretary of State, John Forster Dulles, brother of CIA Director Allen Dulles.

[https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/sites/default/files/documents/6990042/National-Security-Archive-Doc-06-Secretary-of.pdf](https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/sites/default/files/documents/6990042/National-Security-Archive-Doc-06-Secretary-of.pdf)

Supplying Israel with the components and technological know-how was an extremely controversial topic in the 1950s, particularly with the rise of Nationalists like Egyptian President Nasser and the vast amount of crude oil he and his fellow Arabs controlled. It would have to be conducted covertly - possibly without the knowledge of President Eisenhower for a measure of “plausible deniability”- and thus responsibility fell into the lap of **Vice President Richard Nixon**. The operation would be conducted outside of CONUS to ensure complete secrecy – and the man in charge of the CIA’s “Israeli Account”, **James Jesus Angleton** was the project director. Frankfurt, West Germany, would provide the perfect cover. The 97% percent U-235 used in the NERVA nuclear rocket engine was the perfect source of bomb material. In the 1950s, normally the only way to get rid of HEU material was to detonate it. It would have been incredibly difficult for the CIA to obtain HEU from an already assembled weapon (and probably have them face the firing squad if caught doing so). A nuclear rocket engine, however, burned the HEU in a controlled fashion using hydrogen – therefore making it easy to “misplace” a few hundred kilograms. In fact, the Director of the NUMEC facility, noted **Zionist Dr. Zalman Shapiro**, actually charged Westinghouse for the lost HEU. Once the loss of several hundred kilograms of HEU was discovered, NUMEC had to re-imburse them. The Dulles brother’s good friend, industrialist **John McCone**, was the Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission from July 1958 to January 1961 and may have assisted in providing continuing cover for the operation. McCone took over as DCI when President Kennedy fired Dulles over the Bay of Pigs fiasco.

The possibility of some form of nuclear weapon engineering program is inferred from the United States’ seemingly rapid reversal of policy regarding the creation of a Jewish homeland in the Middle East after 1947. The British Government’s decision to walk away from three decades of “Mandatory Palestine” policy within about 8 months has never been satisfactorily explained, and caused cracks to appear in the UK-USA relationship. Was there some kind of “behind the scenes” pressure from the United States to force their hand?

**David L. Christ**

As one of the first true engineer / scientists that the CIA hired in 1950, Christ would have had a lot on his plate. A gifted electrical engineer in the physical audio security fields, it is curious why he had a “Need to Know” requirement to access Top Secret – Restricted data regarding nuclear weapons design and materials. Was Christ involved in the Israeli nuclear program?

As the top-rated audio expert in the CIA, he was also called upon to install listening devices at a Chinese news station in Havana on the 17th August 1960, returning on the 30th August. However, for some (as yet) unknown reason, Christ went back into Cuba on the 17th September 1960 and was arrested, along with two other CIA officers and a State Department employee. Christ was travelling under the cover name of Daniel Carswell, and the four Americans were imprisoned for two and a half years.

Christ also had trouble convincing his CIA bosses of the need to take certain personnel with him to Havana:

Although his citation for the Intelligence Medal states that he “successfully maintained his cover”, it is now conceivable that the Cubans extracted information regarding the Israeli nuclear program from Christ using torture methods. This would explain Hunts’ claim of “Cuban Government reports relating to the Kennedy assassination” being the reason for the Watergate burglary. Facing re-election, President Richard Nixon was concerned that Christ had revealed the Israeli nuclear weapons program, of which he had presided over in the Eisenhower administration. Any evidence that Nixon had run such a controversial program, coupled with the fact that President Kennedy had clashed with the Israelis over the Dimona nuclear plant’s function, would undoubtedly have torpedoed Nixon’s re-election campaign.

From the Watergate Tapes:

Jefferson Morely’s excellent piece in Politico in June 2022 describes the “mutual blackmail” situation Nixon and Helms found themselves in.

[https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/06/05/nixon-helms-cia-jfk-assassination-00037232](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/06/05/nixon-helms-cia-jfk-assassination-00037232)

It also explains why fellow “Q” clearance holder and ex-CIA Audio Specialist James McCord was pulled out of retirement to lead the burglary - they needed someone with technical knowledge of nuclear weapons to quickly review anything they found to determine its importance. The other Plumbers were of Cuban extraction, probably involved for their translation abilities. In his Church Committee testimony, Angleton stated he had “used McCord twice” in operations – one of which was a “difficult overseas assignment that had to be absolutely water-tight – no leaks”, and the other one where he had “made a mistake”. McCord’s overseas travel records indicate he had several trips to Europe for the CIA, but in each instance, for two weeks to a month. His longest posting was to Frankfurt, Germany from July 1962 to June 1964, for which he required a “Q” clearance and obtained just prior to departure. Again, as a physical and audio security specialist, why would he have a “Need to Know” about nuclear weapons? At the completion of his Frankfurt posting, he was then allowed to attend the Air Warfare College as an overt CIA officer, where he obtained his Masters degree – was this a reward for a “job well done” assembling nuclear warheads for Israel? The HEU from NUMEC could only be used in the simple gun-type nuclear weapon, as used in Hiroshima. For the NERVA fuel, the HEU was coated with a ceramic compound that would have had to have been removed and reconfigured into the half-hemispheres required for such a weapon to work. West German metallurgical technical know-how would have been invaluable in this endeavour, using a covert CIA annex in Frankfurt. The gun-type weapon would have only been a stop-gap measure until the Dimona nuclear plant produced enough plutonium by-product for more effective implosion-type weapons. As Angleton was running the show, he used his other role to deploy some counter-intelligence into the mix; he circulated stories in the British and Israeli press stating that Egyptian President Nasser was using West German scientists to develop nuclear weapons:

Angleton was in the thick of it too with regards to Watergate; as he was most likely directly mentioned in any of the reports the DNC might have relating to the Israeli nuclear program, he had a TON of skin in the game. Watergate might have been the second time Angleton referred to as using McCord – the one where he “made a mistake”.

Christ continued to work for the CIA after his release from the Cuban prison; his records in the 2022 JFK file release indicate he was given access to the EARPOP compartment, which was a NRO/NSA program to collect the ELINT signatures of Sino-Soviet radars using satellites. He retired from the CIA in 1970 to work in private industry. There were certain things other CIA officers weren’t allowed to discuss with him though, which have never been disclosed (perhaps something that might ""trigger"" him, after being exposed to torture / mind-kontrol techniques?):

The person who wrote the citation for Christ's Intelligence Medal was Carl E. Duckett. Later on in 1976, perhaps in an effort to ""cover the CIA's tracks"", Duckett writes a memo to the then DCI, George H.W. Bush, stating that the CIA believed that HEU had been diverted to Israel from the NUMEC plant.

**Part 1: Luria’s “mystical” interpretation of expulsion from Spain**

Lurianic Kabbalah can be described as a mystical interpretation of Exile and Redemption, reflecting the deepest religious feelings of the Jews of the time, **as they recovered from, and contemplated the implications of the blow of Expulsion from Spain in 1492**. For them, Exile and Redemption were great mystical symbols, pointing to parallel processes in the Divine Being. And this implies a new moral idea of humanity – **the man** of spiritual action who, through the process of “Tikkun,” or Perfection, **ends the Exile**, the historical Exile of the People of Israel and the Exile of the Creator.

**Part 2: Everyone can contribute to end times VS necessity of having a “chosen one”**

Isaac Luria's plan emphasized the **democratic** **role** **of each person** in redeeming the fallen spark of holiness, assigning the Messiah **only the final arrival in the process**, but Nathan of Gaza interpreted the role of the Messiah as vital in regaining the spark of holiness lost to impurity

[https://academic-accelerator.com/encyclopedia/lurianic-kabbalah](https://academic-accelerator.com/encyclopedia/lurianic-kabbalah)

Nathan of Gaza envisioned Sabbatai Zevi as the next messiah for the Jewish people. However, Sabbatai Zevi's acceptance of this messianic role was not instantaneous. His first encounter with Nathan of Gaza was not about his position as the next Jewish savior, but rather as a patient to a doctor. At the time, Nathan of Gaza was becoming well known as a spiritual physician. Sabbatai Zevi visited him in hopes of curing him from an illness that he had contracted. ([Gershom Scholem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gershom_Scholem) later believed that Sabbatai Zevi suffered from a psychological condition he identified as ""manic-depressive psychosis"", today normally called ""[bipolar disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder)"".) Instead of trying to aid him with his psychological sickness, Nathan of Gaza divulged to Sabbatai Zevi his prophetic vision. Initially, when ""…Nathan addressed him as the messiah, 'he laughed at him and said, 'I had it \[the messianic vocation\], but have sent it away.' '"" It was only through intense discussion and much persuasion that he was able to sway Sabbatai Zevi into accepting his messianic mission. Then, in May 1665, Sabbatai Zevi made the decision that would place Nathan of Gaza and himself in the public sphere forever. He exposed himself to the world as the true savior.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan\_of\_Gaza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_of_Gaza)

*Note*: This was a big deal because of the timing (1666) a lot of people thought it could be the end of the world

**Part 3:**  **“purification through sin”**

Sabbetai Zevi used the teachings and lessons of Lurianic Kabbalah in a negative and destructive way... Lurianic Kabbalah made very clear: you cannot use sin as an excuse to connect to God. The Torah says it is forbidden and that’s the end of it.

Where Sabbetai Zevi took it too far, was going against this accepted knowledge and saying you could use sin to sanctify the world, paradoxically\[...\]. And so, his followers went to town: They ate non-kosher, they desecrated the Sabbath, and they engaged in forbidden sexual relations (sometimes openly).

His followers (up to a third of Jews worldwide) believed in and hoped he would be the Messiah that they had all been waiting for.

*Note*: This is from quora so it may be just an approximation of the truth

Gershom Scholem explains\[...\] Sabbatai showed symptoms of bipolar syndrome which increased in severity as he matured. In his manic states, Sabbatai often did strange and even forbidden things\[...\] Sabbatai’s messianic pretensions were not caused by this condition but were certainly abetted by it.

153,17gz52k,2023-10-26,conspiracy,Nakba 2.0,"As mentioned in other posts of mine, the ultimate Israeli goal may in fact be to push as many Gazans out of Gaza as possible and into neighboring countries such as Egypt or Jordan as well as other countries all around the world from European nations to Canada 

&#x200B;

This would result in a new Nakba aka Catastrophe aka great displacement of the Palestinian people

&#x200B;

This would lower their numbers even more thus creating a larger Israeli majority 

&#x200B;

This would create a new refugee crisis for various countries such as those in Europe 

&#x200B;

They could do this under the guise of setting up humanitarian corridors through the Rafah border crossing with Egypt and Gaza 

&#x200B;

They'll create hell on earth by turning Gaza into rubble as they've been doing for years but more intensely than ever since Oct 7, 2023

&#x200B;

This is why they are cutting off water, food, fuel, electricity, internet, etc at least in part. Make Gaza uninhabitable & force Gazans to leave. Pressure them to surrender. Make them want to leave because they cannot stand it anymore

&#x200B;

The idea is that this would force hundreds of thousands if not more to flee 

&#x200B;

After they do, they will not be allowed to return

&#x200B;

Then they can take over Gaza not just militaristically via occupation but politically and ethnically as they have done with the West Bank and East Jerusalem thus completing the takeover.

&#x200B;

They can do this via direct annexation or by turning Gaza into a client state. Then under the guise of rebuilding Gaza they can add more illegal settlements for Israelis to settle here

&#x200B;

To this day and for the past many decades, countless Palestinian refugees already live outside of Palestine in refugee camps amongst other places in a variety of countries not being able to return

&#x200B;

New refugee camps and tent cities can be set up in neighboring countries like Egypt's Sinai region 

&#x200B;

This plan may actually be a part of Israeli strategic thinking as revealed by an Israeli think tank linked to Netanyahu which promotes a ‘unique opportunity’ to ethnically cleanse Gaza

&#x200B;

On October 17, the Misgav Institute for National Security & Zionist Strategy published a position paper advocating for the “relocation and final settlement of the entire Gaza population.” The report advocates exploiting the current moment to accomplish a long-held Zionist goal of moving Palestinians off the land of historic Palestine. The report’s subtitle makes it clear: “There is at the moment a unique and rare opportunity to evacuate the whole Gaza Strip in coordination with the Egyptian government.” 

&#x200B;

This reminds me of Klaus Schwab's quote during the plandemic- 

""The pandemic represents a rare but narrow window of opportunity to reflect, re-imagine and reset our world"" 

&#x200B;

This may all be part of much bigger plans aka to erase the Palestinian state forever and create a Greater Israel by following the Yinon Plan at least in part 

&#x200B;

Even if they do ""hand over"" Gaza to the Ramallah, West Bank based Palestinian gov of Fatah/PLA ""led"" by Mahmoud Abbas, this will largely be symbolic with ultimate control held by Israel just like the West Bank

154,17cq37s,2023-10-21,conspiracy,Israel with overwhelming support,"This might be more of a controversial take than anything else, but I can't see it fly on other subreddits so here we go. 

 ^(Just because this is Reddit after all, I will preface that I am an outsider. I don't practice either religion, have no personal connections, have never visited, and haven't followed the conflict before in any meaningful detail beyond 'feeling bad for the people there'.)  


I simply don't understand how everyone on the web seems comfortable with the fact that their governments and people are supporting Israel without a shadow of a doubt simply because TERRORIST BAD. I want you to think hard about what just happened. From my understanding, this conflict first arose from the all-time classic euro/US move of carving up a random ass piece of land. They placed a long-repressed group there so they could do their freedom thing, and boom, problem solved. We all know what happens next. The repressed group does some repressing of their own.

Skip forward to today, and we have Israel, a modernized, democratic, mostly Jewish powerhouse with a good military,US support, and 90% other western support. Why did I mention Jews? I know conspiracy theorists love the idea of mighty evil Jewish people running the world, but this is the worst time for this shit. The reality is that their 'groups' have been oppressed badly in the past, and people still feel guilt decades later. Enough guilt to conveniently turn hate from a terrorist attack by a group into a lack of sympathy or even hatred towards a whole country? Perhaps, especially in the USA, France... After listening to a few clips of their 'defense' minister, I can't say he convinced me that Israel will play fair at all. I saw Joe's speech. While he says he stands for protecting civilians and how you need to make the terrorists loose, I think we know that's just not how USA operates in practice (not to mention that there is a 99% chance someone else wrote it for him).

On the other side, there is Palestine. Let's not pretend it's perfect, but the reality is that they have never had it good either. They never recovered from previous conflicts, unlike Israel. As you would expect, a decent chunk of the population is made up of children, and the people are poor. I don't think it's that crazy that a terrorist organization would form in these conditions, do you(reminds me of a few in recent years)? It's like maybe you should prevent this from happening in the first place or something... Sure, everyone agrees that the terrorists need to get gone, but I would argue that what you do after and during the process is where things go in very different directions.

Do you let Palestine go free? Let civilians live their lives. Establish themselves. Or do you crack down, take what you can, and twist the narrative. They have been fighting for land for years, and they did unspeakably horrible things to random civilians. Would you trust the same people to decide what's the right course of action is? Just like there are antisemitic people in Europe right now there are 100% anti-Palestinian people in Israel, and I'm sure they won't just let it go. I believe everyone could be taken advantage of RIGHT NOW to fulfill a goal only a select few have. If you asked an average Palestinian or Israeli person that lives there what should happen, I genuinely don't think either would want extra pain for each other (because they know no normal civilian would do shit like that). But some extremists surely do, and I am sure plenty of them will be left walking around freely afterwards on both sides. If you ask me, a partial+ overtake is never off the table. 

If this doesn't get handled properly an intervention from China/Russia/India... could fuck everything up even more and for many more people that may not care now.

I also can't just gloss over EU's position. They are obligated to feel bad for Israel, but at the same time that they support it, they also sanction it? Giving humanitarian support to Palestine while at the same time enabling Israel. They pretend like they are happy to take any kind of refugees. Than proceed not to integrate them at all, making the situation shit for locals and them in the long run. Is it shocking that refugees from Palestine would support Palestine in a conflict they themselves got away from but still have connections to. Locals want to deport them because there is an unaffiliated terrorist organization there now, but they don't care for Israeli actions at all? Saying clearly racist shit, but it's fine as long as it's gypsies, Syrians or Palestinians? 

I guess some invasions are okay if you blame them on a terrorist attack and they're directed at unwanted groups? The conclusion is, of course NO. And there are many people who don't think so. It was shocking to see just how many are comfortable with it. Just how many speak about it with hatred, passion and everything in between. A lot of people have forgotten what it feels like to get trapped in this type of situation.

I know I didn't do a good job of writing this, and I know most people here could easily out-argue me and turn it around. The situation genuinely caught me off guard, and I didn't see any discussion, at least in my locale, in this direction; it was focused exclusively on terrorism and live reporting of the attack and bombing of Gaza.

Feel free to say anything. I am open for discussion from different sides. Also feel free to correct me if there is awareness on this and I just missed it.",kkkk_88,t2_icgxm7bx,0.5,0,5
155,179gggh,2023-10-16,conspiracy,HAMAS+Israel-Palestine =Contra+US-Nicaragua,"Prologue:

For those that were unfamiliar, The CIA trained and funded the conflict of Nicaragua between the Contras and the Sandinistas. The Sandinistas we a pro-democracy militia within Nicaragua. During the time the people of Nicaragua wanted a government of the people, but a banana company owned by Sullivan and Cromwell(US firm) didn't want this to happen because the candidate was pro workers rights, this cutting into the cost of cheap labor. Eventually a Revolution occured and a Nicaragua would have a worker's rights government. The Contras were trained by the CIA who was lead by Allen Dulles, a former employee of Sullivan and Cromwell. This operation required to push the narrative that the Sandinistas were soviet communists for wanting Nicaraguans to have workers rights. In a Anti-Communist era, Ronald Reagan was easily able to convince the American people that the Sandinistas were the bad guys and the CIA's Contras were the good guys. Contras eventually were successful and were able to elect a government to keep business as usual, and the US government would be able to have a close eye within their government.



Theory:

HAMAS is ultimately being funded by Israel so they could destabilize Palestine and forcibly remove Palestinians from the state without losing favour of the world stage.  The US has given Israel $150billion for military aid since 1948. Ukraine has received $75 billion from the US to fight against what is perceived as the 2nd strongest army in the world. Ukrainian weapons have been found by IDF in HAMAS possession. Maybe Israel is paying Russia to move seized Ukrainian weapons to supply HAMAS? In the end, innocent civilians are getting the brunt of the conflict and this is just a theory without concrete evidence.


Why:
What might Israel have to gain from Palestine?

 It might be possible that Israel is attempting to attract larger businesses to settle on Palestinian territory. 

Perhaps the nation is seeking additional funding from nations which could be eventually diverted to Netayahu's accounts. 

Is it possible that an influx of Palestinian refugees could be purposefully used to destabilize neighboring countries of Israel? unless those countries are profiting off of human trafficking, in which would Israel also be receiving a percentage of a finder's fee?

Let me start by saying I just finished watching the show two weeks ago so it's all very fresh to me. To anybody who doesn't know, the show The Leftovers revolves around the events of October 14th/The Vanishing - where 2% of the population completely vanished in a second. 

An answer to why they disappeared was never introduced, but throughout the show, whenever there were conspiracy theorists around, they would always allude to an Israeli connection or a Mossad connection. On this October 7th (2023), exactly a week before October 14th, the worst massacre to jewish people since the holocaust occurred, wiping thousands of people and a war started. In a similar way to the vanishing, in Israel you will also not find a person who doesn't know at least one person who has died or kidnapped. In 2013, Henry Kissinger said that ""in 10 years Israel will cease to exist"". We are now in the 10 years later. The leftovers came out a year later, in 2014.

Everyone's fear is grounded in a deeply concerning reality: the erosion of freedom of speech in our everyday lives. It's not just about the Israel-Palestine war or any specific issue; it's about a pervasive atmosphere where expressing dissenting views can jeopardize your livelihood, your social standing, and your future prospects. This atmosphere is reminiscent of a dystopian points-ranking system, where deviating from the accepted narrative could lead to public shaming, humiliation, and even loss of everything you hold dear. This chilling effect is not a product of war but a growing trend that silences voices of dissent even before conflicts erupt.

The situation becomes even more unsettling when it extends to celebrities and public figures. These influential individuals, who could potentially use their platform to spark important conversations, are often pressured to conform to prevailing agendas. When they don't, they face intense scrutiny, character assassination, and sometimes complete ruin.

Amidst this disconcerting reality, it's essential to recognize the power of compassion and genuine human connection. In a world dominated by online interactions, taking a step back from the screens and engaging in real conversations with family and friends becomes paramount. These personal connections remind us of our shared humanity and the importance of empathy in understanding differing viewpoints.

However, it's also crucial to acknowledge the potential for things to worsen. If this trend continues, we risk living in a society where genuine dialogue becomes rare, and fear stifles our ability to express our thoughts openly. The prospect of a future where dissenting voices are entirely silenced is indeed a terrifying one.

But amidst these concerns, **there is hope**. History has shown that societies can change, progress, and become more inclusive. The very fact that people like you are aware of these issues and raising your voice is a testament to the resilience of human spirit. By fostering understanding, embracing empathy, and encouraging open dialogue, we can work towards a future where freedom of speech is not just a right but a lived reality for everyone, regardless of their views. It starts with us, in our everyday conversations and actions, to shape a world where diverse opinions are valued, and where fear no longer holds sway over the power of our voices.",beenzerdonezat,t2_i48slhup,0.45,0,1
162,174o3av,2023-10-10,conspiracy,Some thoughts on the Israel conflict..," ‘Death toll rises as Israel declares war on women and children of Palestine; relentlessly bombing as they hide out from the fighting in their homes with no power, gas, or water.’

They say it’s their 9/11 and they will use it as such, Israel will not only take out the attackers (which is justified) but they will crush what is left of Palestine now with minimal blowback from the international community because they are “fighting terrorism”. Everyone needs to ignore the propaganda and do some research. Israel has been committing genocidal oppression upon Palestine for decades. Technically, Palestine is an occupied territory and under the Geneva convention have the right to resist and defend against their occupying forces. 

Since the mid 1800s Zionists had been colonizing the nation of Palestine. Plans and discussions of this can be found in many historical documents such as the Balfour Declaration of 1917. This gave the funder of the movement, Lord Rothschild, his majesty’s government of England’s blessing and support for the creation of Israel. In none of these discussions was Palestine included or consulted. 

Israel and the Mossad helped create Hamas, supposedly to appease the UN and allow them a democratically elected government. Of course they could not allow a regime which they did not have complete control over. Israel has one of the most modernized, powerful and sophisticated intelligence/military forces in the world, notorious for advanced spy networks active in many countries around the world. They did not allow Hamas to become militant and aggressive by accident and they most certainly were not “blindsided” by this attack. This we know at least from Egypt who tried to warn them, but I assure you they already knew before anyone else. Using logic and critical thinking (not conspiracy theorizing) it’s apparent that this is advantageous to the Israeli government.

Who really knows why Israel and the Zionist lobbies have so much leverage over the governments of the west, something to really think about, no matter the reason it is true. We need equal application of international law across the world with no exceptions. I am striving for objectivity here (as everyone should) with no influence of religion or race, that does not matter to me. We need to stand up for whats right, not accept murderous war crimes or support thereof, from anyone. 

Yes, Israel has the right defend themselves, as we’ve heard 1000 times the past few days, nobody is arguing against that. Of course they need to stop Hamas forces if they are being attacked. The question is, isn’t it all much more nuanced than that? Doesn’t Palestine have the right to defend themselves? Is Israel really a democracy amid a sea of tyranny within the middle east? Doesn’t Israel have all the arms and funds they could need to defend themselves? Shouldn’t the “iron dome” have stopped this attack? How did Hamas get all those western style weapons, like M4 assault rifles? Is Iran really responsible and was Biden’s release of their 6 billion dollars relevant? Haven’t the U.S. and Israel meddled and wanted war with Iran for decades? Isn’t Iran allied with Russia and China, as Israel is allied with NATO?

**This ongoing conflict that has been going on for 50+ YEARS is truly depressing. kids are starving, innocent souls are being killed, and so on.**  
I would like to begin by saying I know too little about the conflict to have a solidified opinion. Having said that I feel as if something strange has happened on October 7th. How has Mossad Completely and utterly not seen this attack. I can't say how. So let's deduce why.  
In the well respected gentlemanly game of chess. There are tactics Always Being Played. If you've played chess before and have a rating of over 700 you will know that sometimes giving up a pawn is worth checkmate. I'm not a conspiracy theorist but I believe, that attack was deemed permissible by the higher ups.  
Why you may ask, well simply. To start a war, Israel **NEEDED** a reason to start a war, and the best way to start a war without repercussions is by making it seem as an act of self-defence.

**final thoughts:**

173,17h7o0w,2023-10-26,conspiracy,Israel and Palestine attacks: Hamas and faction of government of Israel are two heads of the same genocidal monster.,"TLDR: Hamas attacked intellectuals and [hippie-like Israelis](https://www.usatoday.com/story/graphics/2023/10/23/what-is-a-kibbutz-in-israel-meaning/71209413007/), maybe culling holy bloodlines. It took generals hostage who may or may not be [Netanyahu opponents](https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/03/23/israel-netanyahu-protest-military-legal-reform/). Israel attacked Gaza killing many innocents and maybe killing holy bloodlines. It boosted anti-semitism in orders of magnitude, triggering world outrage and a global jihad, and uniting muslim countries against Israel. Only an incompetent leader would not have foreseen this. Both attacks may be part of a larger plan. 

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The attack that Hamas conducted in Israel was notorious and not so  notorious is a crucial detail: the place they attacked, the kibbotz, was some sort of hippie-like communes of peaceful people and intellectuals if Im not mistaken. I think that was no arbitrary cross border raid just attacking Jews. It may have been very well an attack with multipronged objectives. Among them, culling intellectuals and holy bloodlines. Also, need to check whether the vip hostages were opposed to Netanyahu, specially the generals. 

The response to the attack was something largely expected and probably was something even in the plans of Hamas. A very destructive and deadly attack by the government of Israel on Gaza that killed a lot of innocent people. With this Hamas achieved a very important public relations victory when it triggered massive anti-Israel protests worldwide. That victory in the machievallan minds of Hamas probably would have justified the destruction of Gaza. 

But it just starts there. It may have triggered also a global jihad, boosting the respect for Hamas, its financing, its recruting, support for its message even if it couldn't operate under the name Hamas anymore. In addition, muslim countries are coalescing like a single block against Israel, maybe even uniting shia and sunni in one common cause against the Jewish people. 

A national leader would have to  be very incompetent not to see this happening due to a big attack against Gaza that killed large numbers of innocents. I would say that Netanyahu may have known this was going to happen and didn't care for some reason. 

Also, [there have been moves](https://variety.com/2023/film/reviews/praying-for-armageddon-review-1235556393/) to accelerate the end of the world by evangelical extremist forces for the battle of Armageddon.

174,17byyeo,2023-10-20,conspiracy,Israeli Culpability For The Hospital Attack In Gaza,"On Tuesday, Oct 17, 2023, something massive struck a hospital in Gaza called the al-Ahli Arab Hospital causing a huge blast/fire that claimed the lives of hundreds of Gazans & injured hundreds more. It hit the courtyard of the hospital. Hundreds upon hundreds were in that hospital and its courtyard seeking shelter from Israeli attacks. 

&#x200B;

The Al Jazeera live stream recording of a rocket exploding midair took place at 18:59 aka 6:59pm according to its time stamp. 

&#x200B;

According to BBC Verify, the explosion at the hospital happened at around 19:00 local time on Tuesday aka 7pm.

&#x200B;

Predictably, Israel quickly laid the blame upon a misfired PIJ rocket. How do we know it wasn't an errant Israeli missile/rocket either from a drone or fighter jet? 

&#x200B;

As mentioned above, Israel blamed PIJ, not Hamas. Yet Israeli apologists like the American Jewish Committee aka AJC mention that Hamas had fired a R-160 long range rocket at Israel. The two groups are not the same and have separate arsenals of weapons. This rocket is heavier in terms of weight but it was fired by Hamas, not PIJ. Plus, the AJC uses statements made by the IDF as evidence. 

&#x200B;

Furthermore, Qassam Brigades, the armed wing of Palestinian Islamist group Hamas said on Monday aka Oct 16, 2023 that it shelled the northern Israeli city of Haifa with an R-160 rocket. This was reported by JPost. A report by Al Arabiya dated for Oct 11, 2023 also stated that Hamas had fired an R-160. The hospital was hit on Tuesday, Oct 17, 2023 as stated above & the hospital is close to/faces Southern Israel so this R-160 rocket attack would have no need to fly over or near to the attacked hospital if it was striking a target in Northern Israel. Plus, as the dates indicate, they happened on different days.

&#x200B;

If you watch the initial video of the impact upon the hospital which was gelocated by WAPO you can tell by looking at the blast and hearing the audio that it was a very powerful strike/bomb with a huge blast. 

&#x200B;

PIJ/Hamas launch rockets which are usually Qassem rockets along with other smaller/lighter weight rockets which is what they tend to have the largest supply of and these do not pack a punch like what we saw in the impact video. They are not as powerful. They cannot inflict that much damage. They can probably destroy a car or a room but not a hospital or its courtyard. 

&#x200B;

PIJ and Hamas do have more powerful rockets like the aforementioned R-160 or even the Badr 3 missiles but there is no indication/evidence to suggest that they used these at the exact time the hospital was hit. The PIJ sent out a message that they fired rockets at Israel at around the time the hospital was hit but they also said the timing of when they send messages out and when rockets actually get fired don't always correspond. Plus, which rockets were used, where were they fired from, which direction were they headed and what happened to them is not known. 

&#x200B;

Ppl keep focusing upon JDAMs but it doesn't even need to be a JDAM since Israel has missiles/rockets of different weight classes/payloads as well. They could have used any of their array of missiles/rockets. They could have even used a rocket similar to the heavier/more powerful ones that PIJ/Hamas has just so they can blame them. It wouldn't be the first time that Israel was behind a false flag attack. Although, in the initial impact video, it sounds like a JDAM compared to videos/audio of other JDAM attacks which is why I'm assuming the JDAM claim was spread around. 

&#x200B;

According to BBC verify, they said there were several small craters at the scene therefore indicating it wasn't a much larger crater aka suggesting that it couldn't have been an Israeli strike although they admit its still early and inconclusive. However, this only applies if it was a JDAM and not another rocket or missile in Israel's arsenal. The smaller craters of which there were several could easily have been produced by shrapnel or other impacts which is common when something big explodes and the blast radius is wide.

&#x200B;

Channel 4 suggested that what they saw were small craters compatible with mortar strikes rather than missiles. Surrounding buildings only had superficial damage and no structural collapse. The broadcaster said “this makes a ground detonating Israeli missile strike unlikely, but it doesn’t rule out an airburst munition which could cause major loss of life but would produce far less structural damage.”


&#x200B;

The al-Ahli Arab Hospital is located in Gaza City. Gaza City is the site of some of the most frequent/intense bombarding by Israel.

&#x200B;

Israel was also making demands/threats directed at hospitals according to the MSF. For example, on Oct 13, 2023, MSF reported that Israel told them to evacuate a hospital in Gaza according to MSF's twitter feed. It is common for attacking forces to do this to deny their target of any chance at seeking aid kind of like the CIA's double tab drone strikes that hit the target and then hit the same site again after first responders arrive.

&#x200B;

Israel’s military specifically issued evacuation warnings to the al-Ahli Arab Hospital, according to the Anglican Church that runs the medical facility.

&#x200B;

Al-Quds Hospital, the hospital which the Palestine Red Crescent says Israel has ordered to be evacuated – is located in the southwest of Gaza City, in the Tel al-Hawa neighbourhood.
It had previously been rebuilt after sustaining damage in Israeli air raids in 2009.

&#x200B;

According to Al Jazeera, 4 Gaza hospitals have been put out of commission b/c of Israeli attacks.

&#x200B;

Judging by the initial video of the impact, it sounds like a single airstrike hitting the target, not a barrage of rockets or several pieces of a rocket falling such as shrapnel. 

&#x200B;

Although there has been misfires before, no single Palestinian rocket, misfire or otherwise, has ever killed that many ppl and did that much damage ever, not in Israel and not in Palestine.

&#x200B;

The IDF even deleted a video on a post claiming Palestinians were responsible for the hospital strike because the time stamp/date was off.

&#x200B;

In another post, an Israeli official even claimed that they hit a hospital they said was being used by Hamas only to delete it and retract their statement. 

&#x200B;

Also as ""evidence"" the IDF released a recording allegedly of Hamas members discussing a rocket misfire. However, since this recording comes directly from the IDF it should be taken with a grain of salt. Furthermore, it could not be independently verified. Plus, how do we know that the voices heard are in fact of Hamas fighters? How do we know when this was recorded? How do we know which misfire they're talking about?

&#x200B;

In its analysis, Channel 4 said it had found the call’s credibility questionable due to the syntax used, accent and tone of voice.

&#x200B;

Footage reviewed by the BBC, meanwhile, revealed inconsistencies in the reconstruction of events presented by Israeli army spokesperson Daniel Hagari on Wednesday. “The spokesman said it had been fired from a nearby cemetery – and there is a cemetery next to the hospital. But a map displayed by the spokesman showed a launch site further away. We have not been able to locate a cemetery there,” the British network said.

&#x200B;

When Israeli officials/the IDF used the Al Jazeera livestream video as evidence, they used a version without audio.

&#x200B;

According to the Al Jazeera livestream, it shows what appears to be a rocket flying through the sky before appearing to explode in mid air. This could be due to a malfunction or interception. In the video, you can see the rocket break up into pieces. Seconds later, you see a smaller explosion at ground level far away from the hospital at first. Then, several seconds after that, another much larger explosion is seen/heard at the site of the hospital.

&#x200B;

Perhaps the Israelis intercepted the Palestinian rocket and then fired upon the hospital almost simultaneously to camouflage the attack. Israel has radars that track Palestinian rocket launches so they were most likley monitoring them and aware of them.

&#x200B;


It could have also been an interception of Palestinian rockets gone wrong or Israel could have hacked the rocket systems so that they misfire. There are a lot of potential outcomes here. 

&#x200B;

An investigation by Al Jazeera’s Sanad verification team found that Israeli statements seem to have misinterpreted the evidence to build a story that one of the flashes recorded by several sources was a rocket misfire.
Based on a detailed review of all videos, Sanad concluded that the flash Israel attributed to a misfire was in fact consistent with Israel’s Iron Dome missile defence system intercepting a missile fired from the Gaza Strip and destroying it in midair.

&#x200B;

Those using the Al Jazeera live stream video as ""evidence"" are suggesting that this single rocket or shrapnel from it or another rocket not seen in this video is responsible for the massive explosion but this makes no sense. Shrapnel can't cause such a huge explosion and as mentioned already the rocket we see in the video breaks up mid air. Although this video was cited as ""proof"" that it was a Palestinian rocket that hit the hospital by the IDF & Israeli sympathizers, it actually proves nothing.

&#x200B;

Channel 4, which published a video analysis examining the evidence presented by both sides, said there was “no proof that the midair and ground explosions are necessarily linked”.

&#x200B;

All Israel does is deny its wrongdoings, attempts to justify them or deflects blame upon the Palestinians. The Israelis may just be trying to sow confusion and deflect blame as they have done numerous times before. Israel is known to blame the Palestinians for its attacks especially if they end up hitting sensitive locations.


&#x200B;

They denied using white phosphorus. They didnt accept responsibility for the recent attack upon journalists in Lebanon. They denied attacking the hospital. They denied lighting up convoys of fleeing ppl in Gaza.

&#x200B;

Israel killed Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh and originally denied this too. Even after it was found out that they did do it, they never charged the soldiers behind it.

&#x200B;


There have been over 115 attacks on healthcare in Palestine since the start of the conflict on October 7, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). At least 20 hospitals in Gaza City and North Gaza and one hospital in Rafah have received repeated evacuation orders from the Israeli military, and 77 attacks have been documented in the West Bank, 43 of these attacks have caused physical violence to health teams.

&#x200B;

They say not to trust the Hamas controlled Health Ministey but then why should we trust the Israeli controlled IDF? 

&#x200B;

US officials have said that the hospital attack was likley due to a Palestinian rocket misfire as Biden visited Israel. While in Israel, Biden blamed ""the other team"" therefore repeating Israeli claims but why should we believe Israel's top ally? Even an ally of the US/Israel, PM of Canada, Justin Trudeau, has said that he is not ready to accept U.S. findings that a Palestinian militants' rocket was behind the Gaza hospital blast.

&#x200B;

Another ally of Israel & the US, Canada, arrived at the conclusion that Israel was not responsible and that they had a high degree of confidence that this assessment was accurate. What secretive US or Israeli intel they looked at is unknown. Quite frankly, such statements by allies of the potential culprit should mean very little. Imagine the US or Canadian response if Iran or Syria had bombed a hospital or a church and then Russia or China said they had a high degree of confidence that it wasn't them. 

Even in the remote chance that it was a misfired Palestinian rocket and not an Israeli attack, Israel is ultimately to blame for all the violence in this conflict and the ones before it because all of this is happening in the first place b/c Israel created Hamas, b/c of either a massive Israeli intel failure or more likley Israeli foreknowledge/a false flag, and b/c of Israeli aggression, occupation, apartheid, violations of international law/human rights, the blockade, oppression, etc. Plus, such a large group of ppl would not have been taking refuge at the hospital if it wasn't for constant Israeli strikes & Israel's evacuation order.

&#x200B;

Ppl ask why Israel would do this or they outright say that Israel wouldn't do this. These ppl clearly haven't been paying attention. This is what Israel has been doing now and in the past with their scorched earth policy regarding Gaza. They have indiscriminately bombed civilians in Gaza for years. They have bombed mosques, clinics, schools, hospitals, apartments, churches, refugee camps, etc and then simply say Hamas is using human shields and Hamas was using those facilities aka shift the blame upon them or in other words label everything as a viable military target. Hamas may place their assets in civilian areas b/c its hard not to do so as Gaza is a very small, densely packed enclave, quite literally a strip as the name indicates. Furthermore, unlike most armed forces who have their installations in specific, remote locations as they are generally detached from the civilian population, militant groups like Hamas live and operate amongst the people as often times, they are integrared with the community. It is Israel that is intentionally striking locations they know are filled with civilians which clearly shows that they don't care as long as their military objectives are achieved. 

&#x200B;

On Oct 19, 2023, it was revealed that a Greek Orthodox church was bombed in an Israeli strike killing many people who were seeking refuge there. I bet Israel will blame this on the Palestinians too that is unless they aren't too busy planning their ground invasion of Gaza.

&#x200B;

However, let's take a look at some of the highly controversial statements in relation to Palestinians/Arabs made by Israeli politicians amongst others connected to Israel & even US politicians in the past and in more recent times which may not be as well known and clearly suggests that they are no better. 

&#x200B;

In my dealings with those who identify as pro Israel, although they amply mention terrible statements made by Hamas and other Israeli enemies, they ignore or justify incendiary statements made by Israeli officials/politicians and their supporters 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Here are some of the statements- 

&#x200B;


When Israel’s defence minister, Yoav Gallant, ordered a “complete siege” of the Gaza Strip with “no electricity, no food, no fuel, everything is closed”, he said: “We are fighting human animals and we are acting accordingly.”

&#x200B;

Israel's National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir said that Gaza doesn't need humanitarian aid, only “tons of bombs.” 

&#x200B;

Israeli President Isaac Herzog claimed during a news conference that “there are no innocent civilians in Gaza.”

“It is an entire nation out there that is responsible \[…\] It is not true this rhetoric about civilians not being aware, not involved. It’s absolutely not true. They could have risen up. They could have fought against that evil regime which took over Gaza in a coup d’etat,” (This is a false statement as Hamas was elected in 2006 and it was actually a joint Israeli/UK/Fatah/US coup attempt that started the 2007 Fatah-Hamas war) 

&#x200B;

Israel's Deputy Religious Services Minister Matan Kahana said, “If there was a sort of button you could push that would make all the Arabs disappear, send them on an express train to Switzerland,” he said, “I would press that button.”

&#x200B;

Israel's Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said, ""Who was the first Palestinian king? What language do the Palestinians have? Was there ever a Palestinian currency? Is there a Palestinian history or culture? Nothing. There is no such thing as a Palestinian people,” 

&#x200B;

Smotrich also said, ""I think the village of Huwara needs to be erased,” he told a reporter at a conference, “I think the State of Israel needs to do this, and not – God forbid – private citizens.” 

&#x200B;

""Hostages and civilian casualties will be secondary to destroying Hamas, Israel's Economy Minister Nir Barakat told ABC News, ""even if it takes a year."" Asked about the miles of tunnels Hamas has built under Gaza, he said they'd become the ""world's biggest cemetery."" (Does that include the hostages that are most likley there which he claimed are secondary)

&#x200B;

The remark, ""There was no such thing as Palestinians"" is part of a statement by Golda Meir, the then Israeli prime minister, in her second month in office, made in an interview with Frank Giles, then deputy editor of The Sunday Times on June 15, 1969

&#x200B;

When asked last week during a TV interview about the suffering faced by Palestinians in Gaza, former Israeli prime minister, Naftali Bennett, lashed out at the interviewer and said, ""Are you seriously going to keep asking me about Palestinian civilians? What is wrong with you? Have you not seen what’s happened? We’re fighting Nazis,” the former premier shouted. “Shame on you,” Bennett continued, interrupting and accusing the anchor of “spinning a narrative” in favor of the Palestinians. (Apparently all Palestinians are Nazis)

&#x200B;

Ariel Kallner, a member of the Israeli parliament for Benjamin Netanyahu’s Likud party demanded a repeat of the mass expulsion of Arabs in 1948 known to Palestinians as the Nakba or Catastrophe.

""Right now, one goal: Nakba! A Nakba that will overshadow the Nakba of 48. Nakba in Gaza and Nakba to anyone who dares to join! Nakba, because like then in 1948, the alternative is clear.”

&#x200B;

A prominent Israeli journalist and radio presenter, David Mizrahy Verthaim, has called for wholesale bloodletting.

“We need a disproportionate response … If all the captives are not returned immediately, turn the strip into a slaughterhouse. If a hair falls from their head - execute security prisoners. Violate any norm, on the way to victory,” he wrote on X.

&#x200B;

In an echo of the US after 9/11, the Israel Defence Forces posted on X: “You either stand with Israel or you stand with terrorism”. (This is suggesting that if you support Palestine even if you are against Hamas, you are a terrorist. Even if you are neutral, in the eyes of the IDF, you are probably a terrorist. This reminds me of a time not so long ago when those who were against restrictions in relation to covid/the unvaccinated were called radicals/extremists simply b/c they were against the official gov/MSM narrative/made a personal choice) 

&#x200B;

US Republican congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene tweeted: “Anyone that is pro-Palestinian is pro-Hamas.” (I don't think she realizes that you can care for Palestinian civilians while not supporting Hamas) 

&#x200B;

Furthermore, an ad in NYC's Time Square stated the following, ""Be human, stand with Israel."" This suggests that if you are not on Israel's side or are even neutral, you are not human.

&#x200B;

In 1989, Netanyahu lamented that Israel missed the opportunity presented by global attention on China’s repression of pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen square “to carry out mass expulsions among the Arabs of the territories.”

&#x200B;

Despite supporting Ukrainians and being married to the daughter of a Sicilian immigrant, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis took hardline stances on the Israel-Hamas war during a one-day swing through Iowa, telling audiences ""there was never a Palestinian-Arab state in the region and all residents of Gaza are anti-Semitic""

&#x200B;

Desantis also said that the US should refuse any refugees fleeing Gaza.

""We cannot accept people from Gaza into this country as refugees. I am not going to do that,"" DeSantis said in Creston. ""If you look at how they behave — not all of them are Hamas, but they are all anti-Semitic, none of them believe in Israel’s right to exist. None of the Arab states are willing to take any of them.”

&#x200B;

Jordan Peterson, a personal friend of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin “Bibi” Netanyahu, tweeted out, “Give em Hell Netanyahu."" He is essentially giving Israel carte blanche to turn Gaza into a graveyard.

&#x200B;

US Senator Lindsey Graham called for the wholesale destruction of Gaza.

“We are in a religious war here. I’m with Israel. Do whatever the hell you have to do to defend yourself. Level the place,” he told Fox News.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Such statements come from minds & hearts of hate. 

&#x200B;

They generalize and collectivize.

&#x200B;

They are meant to erase Palestine. 

&#x200B;

Such remarks are meant to fuel hate & divide/conquer

&#x200B;

These remarks/the language used is clearly genocidal, hateful, discrimintarory, anti Arab, anti Palestinian & fits perfectly with Israel's murderous actions in Gaza right now.

&#x200B;

If it is wrong to support Hamas for its murderous ways why is it that politicians like Biden and Rishi Sunak state that they ""stand with Israel"" despite their longstanding pattern of habitual murderous actions & discriminatory statements? 

&#x200B;

Many have been cancelled, fired, de-banked, character assassinated, censored, etc for making statements like these but usually directed at others including Jews.

179,17bp0yk,2023-10-19,conspiracy,Multiple Scenarios of the Israel-Palestine War,"1. Israel launches a ground invasion of Gaza while continuing to bombard Gaza from the air and could even launch a sea based attack/invasion. This results in a regional war involving Iranian proxies such as the PMF of Iraq, Hezbollah of Lebanon, the Houthis of Yemen, Syrian militias, armed Palestinian groups in the West Bank, etc. US forces could even be targeted as they have been in Iraq. In this case, the US can still become involved directly.

2. Israel launches a ground invasion of Gaza resulting in a direct military intervention by Iran and Syria which draws in the US, UK, etc and this explodes into the largest ME war ever

3. Israel creates a buffer zone in Gaza that shrinks Gaza's size for the purpose of pushing them back from Israeli territory

4. Israel launches a ground invasion of Gaza, removes Hamas from power and eventually takes it over/annexes it. They could either annex it outright like they did with East Jerusalem or they can slowly take it over/unofficially annex it like they did with the West Bank, settlement by settlement

5. Israel hands Gaza over to Fatah but this is only symbolic as the ultimate masters will be Israel just like they are in the West Bank

6. The Israeli invasion of Gaza results in a protracted, war of attrition. Even if Hamas is disloged as a governing power of Gaza, they become an insurgency similar to what happened in Iraq

7. This war and ground invasion of Gaza could be a way to weaken Iranian proxy forces aka allies in the region so as to make it easier to eventually go after Iran itself and turn it into the next Afghanistan, Yemen, Libya, Somalia, Iraq or Syria. This is why they went after Syria in the 1st place by stoking a revolution there. They wanted to weaken Syria which is the strongest ally of both Russia and Iran in the ME and is the only ME nation that houses Russian troops

8. This war could be meant to provoke a direct war with Iran. The US/Israel have been trying to provoke a war with Iran for years. This could finally be the straw that broke the camel's back. If Iran gets directly involved, perhaps the US/Israel can use this as the perfect excuse to target Iran directly which is what war hawks in both countries have been itching to do. They would finally be able to target Iran's Nuclear program, its drones and its ballistic missile program and turn it into another Syria. However, the question is would Russia get involved in this case as they did with Syria? This time around Russia is busy with Ukraine.

The Balfour Declaration (“Balfour’s promise” in Arabic) was a public pledge by Britain in 1917 declaring its aim to establish “a national home for the Jewish people” in Palestine.

The statement came in the form of a letter from Britain’s then-foreign secretary, Arthur Balfour, addressed to Lionel Walter Rothschild, a figurehead of the British Jewish community.

In the context of Russian history; Russia was founded in Kiev Ukraine. The Russians fled to what became Moscow due to an indefensible position during the Mongol invasion.

My question is could Russia try to use this same justification for its invasion. Yes I understand the world wouldn’t recognize it as they have already stated their reasons for the “special military operation” but Israel has created a precedent in that sense, not in its modern founding but in its annexations.

Could other countries or groups use this same precedent and be legally justified or supported?

192,17bfh9b,2023-10-19,conspiracy,Empowering Peace: A Referendum for Israel-Palestine,"

I've been pondering an idea that could potentially breathe new life into the quest for peace in the Israel-Palestine conflict – a comprehensive referendum. It's a powerful way to directly engage the people who are most affected by the conflict and give them a voice in shaping their future.

**What's a Referendum?**
A referendum is essentially a public vote on a particular issue, and in this case, it could be a set of questions related to the conflict. Every voice, from the elderly to the youngest, matters.

**The Questions:**
1. Should there be a two-state solution?
2. Is Jerusalem a shared city for all?
3. Do you support economic development for both sides?
4. Can there be cultural and educational exchanges for understanding?
5. Commitment to nonviolence and peaceful negotiations?
6. International oversight for peace implementation?
7. Right of return or compensation for refugees?
8. Truth and reconciliation for historical grievances?
9. International recognition of Israel?
10. Security through demilitarization or peacekeeping force?

**Why a Referendum?**
Because the desire for peace is universal, and involving everyone in the process can minimize reliance on leadership and promote unity. It's worth a shot to bring lasting resolution.

**Share Your Thoughts:**
What do you think about this approach? Can a referendum pave the way for a peaceful future for Israel and Palestine?

Let's discuss and explore new avenues for peace together.""

1. the bombing of Palestinian evacuees in Gaza during the 24 hour period.

Do you believe Hamas, in the nature of they're belief and the extremity of what they're willingly capable of doing, is not capable of bombing their own Palestinian people, who were evacuating during the alleged 24 hour window given by Israel. While letting the world and media accuse Israel for the supposed ""genocide"" and ""massacre"" of Palestinian lives.

By the looks of it... Israel gave the Palestinians a way out. But Hamas bombed they're own people to make sure the public & media solidifies the terrors implied by Israel. (Possibly imposing War Crimes etc. again this is my own opinion, and im sorry to those who are suffering)

2. proper response or ""support"" to neither side. But the oppressed.

Since as some of you have mentioned, Hamas is not Palestine, and they were voted in to power by a lower percentage of population?? (not sure) So there is no saying what length they are willing to take this. In the videos circulating. Where is the resistance? Where is Hamas? What are they doing to help those who are injured. Who's side are they really on?

Are they on the side of freedom of the Palestinians? Or are they on the side of extremist muslims who's goal is to bring Israel, Jews and Christians down completely? Is their goal ""taking back what's theirs"" or initiate a world war where they want Islam on top? They want the surrounding countries to retaliate. They want US to intervene. They want Iran. They want Saudi. They want EU. Drain them of resources, and have Russia back in the picture again? IDK just random crap coming out of my mind.

With the events unfolding today with Israel and Palestine, you can see this theory looking like it might actually be true. Israel is SURROUNDED by their enemies and may potentially be destroyed because of The Zionist genocide of the Palestinians.

Jews have been in Palestine peacefully with the Muslims before the establishment of Israel. 

Here is an article from **16 years ago** that explains this in more detail [https://www.sott.net/article/307348-Gathering-All-The-Jews-In-One-Place](https://www.sott.net/article/307348-Gathering-All-The-Jews-In-One-Place)

Below is from the article but I would recommend reading it all for a better explanation. It isn't long. 

Every Israeli prime minister has had to fear in one remote corner of the brain that **the effect of Zionism might be to gather all the Jews in one place for destruction**. This fear has been brought front and center by Iran's Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's criminally irresponsible call for the destruction of the Jewish state.

  The only truth in this statement is found in the words ""the effect of Zionism \[has been\] to gather all the Jews in one place for destruction."" The idea, as implied by Greenway, that this was a mistake on the part of the Zionists who created and continue to control the Zionist state is laughable, mainly because it was patently obvious, from the very outset, that to create a state for Jews in 1948 by stealing land belonging to another people and to proceed to oppress, and periodically murder, the indigenous population over the following 58 years was the best way to ensure a perpetual threat to the Jews of Israel.

Readers, too, will be surprised to learn, that after the Nuremberg Anti-Jewish Race Laws were enacted in Sept., 1935, that there were only two flags that were permitted to be displayed in all of Nazi Germany. One was Hitler's favorite, the Swastika. The other was the blue and white banner of Zionism. The Zionists were also allowed to publish their own newspaper. The reasons for this Reich-sponsored favoritism was, according to the author: **The Zionists and the Nazis had a common interest, making German Jews emigrate to Palestine.**

I don’t think that’d accomplish a damn thing, if anything it would hinder Palestines efforts to defend their country from the oppression placed on them by the Israeli government. Thus putting the power of the Palestine back into the hands of their self appointed leader who in their eyes does not fight for their people’s rights and freedom. I mean look at how much the Palestinian people are suffering, didn’t Israel just last week turn their water back on after cutting the Palestinian people from it? which is in fact something that has happened multiple times over the years. Do Israel bomb hospitals for the past year and either own it, or in time say it’s a HAMAS failed attack?  Allen to just go left unchecked without proof or investigations actually taking place. I think the only way that this can be seen as religious issue is in the eyes of the Israeli government for trying to shun the ideas of the Palestinian people. Keep going.

Imagine, only for a second if in the US, another government had control of our water and power and they cut us off from it whenever they felt like it. (I’m aware that that could never happen, open your mind pls)  It would be absolute chaos in our country, looting, protests, riots, etc. why? because our own people in government positions would not be standing up for us allowing us to truly fight for ourselves and establish our freedom. This is what is going on in the minds of the Palestinian people. Hamas are merely made up of Palestines strongest individuals, freedom fighters if you will, their sole purpose is to end this oppression and control over their people so they can live their own lives. free from other governments dictating when they eat, when they drink, when they sleep, and what they are taught. It’s all corrupt and I encourage people to read between the lines of what the media chooses to show us. you’re telling me that us Americans take our own news w a grain of salt because some people have “hidden agendas” but all of the sudden when a war starts finally getting talked about because people start seeing the corruption, we’re international relations experts as if everything the media shows us is 100% true and factual. 

(Here’s a hot take) I refuse to follow it blindly, this to me looks like history repeating its self. Take the way America a longgggg time ago pushed out the Native Americans from the country they had inhabited before because they couldn’t defend themselves. Palestine (Hamas)(Palestines strongest individuals) doesn’t need to bomb Israel and kill everyone, and I don’t believe that is their mission. I think they just want the freedom to live for themselves and until that side gets talked about they will keep fighting.

205,17mdc61,2023-11-02,conspiracy,Israel- The Ultimate Responsible Party for this Carnage,"I know that this is not what Israeli apologists want to hear nor will they accept it despite the overwhelming evidence

​

However, those who don't subscribe to the false reality that Israeli  apologists adhere to when they suggest/behave as though the  Israeli-Palestine conflict began with Hamas' attack on Oct 7, 2023, know  that it didn't as this conflict spans decades & dates back to at  least 1947. Even if we only examine the Gaza-Israel conflict, it  originated in its present form in 2006

​

For the purposes of this post, I'm not going to be looking at  America's role in this which is vast nor will I examine the role of the  deep state, globalists, the military industrial complex, lobbyists,  think tanks, billionaires, big banks, big oil, etc as that would be a  post all on its own

​

These are the following reasons why Israel/the Netanyahu coalition  gov is ultimately responsible for the currently unfolding events-

​

\-Israel had foreknowledge of Hamas' preparations in Gaza which  included activity along the border, mock drills with makeshift Israeli  settlements, etc. Egypt warned Israel on more than one occasion, the US  had relevant intel on this & even Israeli surveillance soliders  passed along intel on Hamas' activities up the chain of command which  were ignored. Rather than increase security, the usually security  conscious Israel did the opposite. Border/military personnel more or  less disappeared for at least the initial part of Hamas' attack. Israel  has one of the best intelligence forces in the WORLD. There is no way  they didn't see this coming. They knew and let this happen.

​

\-Let's assume that the Israelis didn't know what was about to happen  and there was no foreknowledge in this case. Then this so called  ""suprise"" attack by Hamas would be the biggest intel failure by a  country since 9/11 & we all know that was one big set up. Therefore,  the Israeli gov, military & intel community would ultimately be  responsible for said intel failure. Their gross incompetence led to  their failure to protect their country and ppl.

​

\-Israel is the one that created Hamas in the 1st place. I find it  shocking that more ppl do not know this. Hamas was Israel's project.  They financed it and gave rise to it. This has been publically  documented. They did this to divide and conquer the Palestinians.  Therefore, Israel is ultimately responsible for Hamas' actions. This is  similar to Frankenstein's monster. This is a clear case of blowback.

​

\-Even after blowback became a reality, Netanyahu's policy for years  as Israel's longest serving PM has always been to continue to nurture  Hamas and finance them. As a matter of fact, as early as 2019, Netanyahu  said whoever is against a Palestinian state should be for transferring  funds to Gaza, because maintaining a separation between the PA in the  West Bank and Hamas in Gaza helps prevent the establishment of a  Palestinian state.

​

\-Israel's occupation, apartheid, blockade & oppression of the  Palestinian ppl over the course of many decades are the primary reasons  for the cycle of violence. Rather than continually infringing upon the  rights, freedoms & statehood of Palestine, they could have come to  the table of peace & this issue would have been resolved years ago.  Oppression breeds resistance.

​

\-Although such policies have been ongoing for years, under the  ultra-nationalist, zionist, coalition gov led by Netanyahu and his Likud  Party, settler violence against the West Bank based Palestinians has  increased, illegal settlement building has risen, there are frequent  raids upon West Bank/East Jerusalem neighbourhoods/camps including  Jenin/Shiekh Jarrah, raids/the storming of the Temple Mount which houses  the third holiest site of Islam, the Al Aqsa Masjid, has become more  frequent. Only a few days before the Hamas attack, this site was stormed  by Israeli settlers yet again.

​

\-It has also been revealed that Israel's response to the Hamas attack  in Israel on Oct 7 and the immediate days that followed amplified  Israeli casualties. The chain of command going all the way to the top,  authorized the military to kill all enemy forces in Israel via any means  neccessary even if it meant killing/injuring Israelis & destroying  Israeli homes/neighbourhoods. For example, they used tanks/shelled homes  even though they knew Israelis were inside. This means that a lot of  the damage, deaths & injuries inflicted upon Israel during the  initial Hamas attack were self inflicted.

They are supposed to be one of the best intelligence agencies in the world, yet had absolutely no clue that this attack was coming.

We are talking about an attack carried out by thousands of militants that simply all planned to cross the border and wreak havoc.

This must have been discussed on telegram channels, in person, talked about by participants, and whatever other insecure channels you can think of.

Basically what I’m saying is there should have been no way that Mossad had absolutely no idea this was coming appearently.

And that is where it gets weird cause you start to consider the motivations for letting an attack like this happen.

It makes me think of Pearl Harbour and 9/11 which are similar at the very least massive failings of U.S. intelligence agencies. In both these cases we used the attack to garner support for wars otherwise unpopular with the people.

212,17rk930,2023-11-09,conspiracy,The Palestine March & Remembrance Parade,"This has been on mind for a few weeks now, but since I deleted Facebook and Twitter over a year ago now I don't really have anywhere to post this so I thought I'd throw it on here since it's likely the only subreddit where this isn't going to get immediately deleted.

So there has been news reports for the last week in the UK about how Muslims and *The Left* are organising a pro-Palestinian march for this Sunday to coincide with the Remembrance Parade that takes place every year at the Cenotaph to remember Armed Service personnel who died in battle during WWI and beyond.

I say *The Left* in italics because quite often things get boiled down a Left Vs Right thing which obviously never quite works. I consider myself a social conservative, so I am technically of *The Right*, but I can't stand a lot of the so-called Right-Wing Zionist shills. So on this issue it places me personally in a strange situation. I don't support Hamas, but can absolutely sympathise with ordinary Palestinians. I don't support Zionists, but I can absolutely sympathise with ordinary Israeli civilians. I absolutely cannot support Islamists and their moronic left-wing allies in the West, but I also absolutely cannot support British conservatives and so-called nationalists who place Zionist causes above British interests.

So with all this said as a preface, I thought I'd go over a few issues here and perhaps help both *The Left* and *The Right* find a mutual position here.

Firstly, let's point out the real big one: **The fact that Zionist Banks in both America and Britain deliberately prolonged WWI in exchange for the Balfour Declaration.**

During WWI, the war had led to a stalemate in which the British were considering armistice. A peace agreement between the Allies and the Central Powers in either 1916 or 1917, would have saved millions of lives from America, Europe and the Levant. So why didn't it happen? One of the most prevalent reasons given is that the American's entrance into the war (using German U-boat activity as a precursor) was agreed behind closed doors because of the strong Zionist lobby within the American government.

In other words, the Balfour Declaration, which gave Zionist Jews the promise of Palestine, led to millions more deaths of Americans, Europeans, Arabs and Turks. So how many Goyim was Israel worth?

This is all before we point the finger at who exactly were responsible for the rise of Communism and the destabilisation of Germany. Simply put, had the war ended more amicably then we might also have avoided WWII altogether and even more deaths, not to mention the holocaust which we're told is the entire reason that we can never question Isra..... oh wait. Maybe there's something in that. *(Why the hell is the holocaust even called the ""holocaust""? Ho-hum.)*

Second issue with this whole farce is this: **141 British Service Personnel were killed in Palestine during  1945-1948, mostly by Jewish terrorists.**

During the first Palestinian conflict, both Arabs and Jews attacked Commonwealth soldiers posted there  who tried to maintain the peace, however (despite Britain's promise to slowly hand-over control) most British deaths were the result of Zionist attacks, not Arabs - which is ironic given that it was Britain that was openly facilitating a population replacement.

To put it into context, around 457 British service personnel died in Afghanistan in two decades of counter-insurgency work, so 141 is not a small number.

Why on earth are these facts always ignored by so many of the pundits on *The Right* in media discourse? I mean I have my suspicions of course... but I doubt I'm allowed to voice them on Reddit.

This is before we point out things like, oh I don't know, the fact that Israel continued to sell anti-ship missiles to Argentina during the Falklands conflict.

The TLDR to all of this is: The left and the right are equally co-opted by vested interests and nuanced, reasoned debates that take facts into consideration are deliberately prevented from being expressed because information like what I've written above blow all of these media mouthpieces out of the water.",EstuarineDreamz,t2_ex9rthpho,0.31,0,1

Big tech harvests data not only for money. Obviously money is a capitalistic incentive, but big tech needs the data for the all seeing eye, neo-colonization. Big tech now pushing stories like Andrew Tate, or god-prince Harry killing Talibans or not congress having speaker drama. Why? Various reasons.

God-Prince Harry says his unit killed 25 Talibans. Now all the media is gonna be busy with it. This is a distraction. The empire needs to stay ahead of the story. The story is that British American neo colonizers tried to create psyops in Twitter to colonize the middle east for oil.

https://youtu.be/uLK5QP9JKXc


US army also had zero unit night raids where they just attack villages and kill random people. These are called terrorist in training a.k.a. TIT. US kills people from a village then Pentagon considers that family or tribe as potential terrorist because there will be repercussion.

For few months, SAS is already under investigations for possible war crimes in 2012. Australia's new government wants investigations for Australian soldiers 

So that's why god-prince Harry needs to distract you. They need to distract you from the night raids and war crimes.

They want you distracted from the American psyopera. Reddit and Twitter promote hatred in middle east. Many subreddits are there to spread hatred or to groom children. In the middle east subreddits they will shadow ban you if you talk about how every industry is connected. Every industry has one job, to help Israel in Palestine and Saudi Arabia in Yemen.



Why is Andrew Tate viral in YouTube shorts even though YouTube bans any videos that have a voice similar to James Corbett's voice? 

What's happening is not what's really happening. Agents of the matrix want to distract you from piezoelectric universe.


When do stupid flat earthers post in this subreddit? Whenever some personality goes to Joe Rogan and talk about how ancient civilizations knew about cosmology, flat earthers gets paid by CIA and start to post about stupid stuff. They want to distract people from velikvosky.

Tahitian used to sail to Hawaii, a few thousand miles north, using the proper motion of arcturus. Can stupid flat earthers do that?


Now 1918 Joe Rogan invited John reeves of Boneyard Alaska. Reeves found tens of thousands/hundreds of thousands of mammoths in Fairbanks Alaska. These mammoths died in younger drya cataclysm. 
There was probably a corridor between ice caps in Fairbanks, with Fairbanks being water source.

Some dead mammoths are 12000 years old and some are 5000 years old. This means either mammoths didn't not all die in there, or there is a problem with the carbon dating system. too many charged particle screw up carbon dating.


Reeves even ate mammoth meat. Some of the meat are not too poisonous because they are flash frozen.


However velikvosky and Thunderbolts ⚡ project  know this 150 years ago. When in 1880 scientists explored Alaska they found a lot of mammoths and dogs ate some of the meat without problems.

Human incompetence plus social media doesn’t really equal secrecy. But this is just an idea I wanted to share.

By the Israeli Palestine conflict, I don’t just mean the current hot conflict, but the conflict in its entirety, where there is an oppressed majority muslim population and the oppressor is a western backed majority Jewish population.

Doesn’t this conflict kind of unite all Muslims in the Middle East? After all, the Middle East isn’t really that harmonious, a unified Palestine would mean that Middle Eastern countries has to focus on other conflicts such as Sunni and Shia Muslims, modernization and fundamentalism, and the massive wealth inequality. These are a lot closer to home and would spell division instead of unity. A unified Israel would also not be desirable since the Middle Eastern countries would live with a western backed nuclear power.

221,z5dwu3,2022-11-26,conspiracy,"Khazar Theory, Middle East Rhetoric","I'm fascinated by this subject. Can we please have an honest conversation? Here are some observations of mine.

The international community loves repeating a wide-spreading narrative spearheaded by terror groups and Black Hebrew Israelites, saying that Jews don't have a claim to the land of Israel. It is based on verifiably false statements that Jews aren't the true Israelites, but descend from the Khazarian Kingdom. In reality, genetic tests prove that Ashkenazi (Paternal) Y-DNA descends from a common Middle Eastern ancestral population, *exactly* where the original Israelites were. Their maternal ancestors were mainly European converts, who became Jewish when Middle Eastern Hebrews migrated to Europe during the Middle Ages. *Even today, Jews around the world are more related to each other than to their local population*. *(Ex: a Chinese Jew has more similar DNA to a Brazilian Jew than to local Chinese people.)* Every genetic study has unanimously proven that Ashkenazi Jews don't descend from Khazars. Ashkenazis do not share any of their DNA, so that theory is laughable. Why do people still spread it?

The land of Israel has constantly been warred over since Jews were kicked out by the Romans, who first named it Palestine. For almost 2,000 years after the Kingdom of Israel was conquered, they were forced to flee from *every* other country they went to. Finally, after 6 million Jews were exterminated in the Holocaust, the British agreed to sell them Palestine. Many Holocaust survivors immigrated there and helped build the modern State of Israel. Unbeknownst to many people, returning to the Motherland was something that *every generation* of Jews prayed for, from the time of the Roman exile. 

As for the apartheid rhetoric, there are nearly 2 million Muslims living in Israel, which is a country the size of New Jersey, and they live with the same rights as Israelis. There are many Muslims who hold Israeli government positions. Unless you change the definition of apartheid, it does not meet the criteria. If the Palestinians dropped their weapons tomorrow, there would be a two-state solution. If Israelis dropped their weapons tomorrow, there would literally be no State of Israel. The Palestinian government has repeatedly rejected any two-state solution that has been brought to the table. There have been prepared solutions, ready to be signed, but the Palestinians backed out, announcing that they would not stop until they wiped Israel off the map (""force them into the sea""). Just look it up!

The Palestinian people are under the control of a known terrorist group, Hamas, that runs their government. They are being used as human shields and forced into harm's way to generate international headlines. They lack basic resources because the government bleeds them dry spending on terror and war. It's disgusting, and the international community is being manipulated by evil people. I pray for the innocent Palestinians who are subjugated to such suffering and brainwashing.

224,176i8hi,2023-10-12,conspiracy,Israeli Crimes & Exceptionalism,"The attack upon Israel smells strongly of being a false flag for several reasons including that Egypt warned Israel in advance, the highly advanced/effective surveillance apparatus of Israel, the timing of the attacks, Israel's muted initial response to said attacks & with Israelis themselves including even former IDF soldiers speaking up and saying that even cockroachs could be detected at the border

With that being said, here is everything that Israel has already done in just the first few days of fighting since the Hamas attack that we should also be condemning as terrorism but won't because of the reflexive nature of the presstitues & poLIEticians to automatically and unconditionally support Israel while solely labeling the Palestinians as terrorists

This exceptionalism and monoplistic claim upon ""legitimate violence"" is what enables them to continue as the international community closes their eyes to the highly egregious atrocities committed by Israel. Not only do they ignore Palestinian suffering but western countries like France via Macron have gone as far as banning pro Palestinian protests

As of Oct 13, 2023, even before a ground invasion has commenced, Israel has already committed the following atrocities-

1. Israel has announced a siege upon Gaza which is even worse than the blockade upon the enclave that has been ongoing since 2005 aka 18 years b/c now electricity, fuel, medicine, water & food have been cut off. This is a human rights and international law violation. Apparently, 
Ursula Gertrud von der Leyen, 13th president of the European Commission, will only condemn this if Russia does it to Ukraine but not if Israel does this to Palestine. It is an example of genocide in the making via mass starvation & collective punishment. Hitler's Nazi Germany is known to have used starvation as a weapon. Gaza's hospitals are running out of medicine and it's power plant has shutdown. The only crossing point into Gaza is the Rafah border crossing with Egypt and Israel has bombed it on several occasions stopping aid from getting through

2. Israel is said to have killed 45+ people in an attack upon an apartment block in the densely populated Jabalia refugee camp in Gaza 

3. Israel has used the banned white phosphorus against Palestinians 


4. Benjamin Netanyahu telling Gazans to ""get out"" is a clear example of mockery b/c he knows that they can't leave due to Israel's siege/blockade. The siege/any humanitarian corridors that are set up come with a hidden agenda. It is most likley meant to create such terrible conditions in Gaza that would then force many Gazans to flee their homes into neighboring Arab countries so as to make it easier for Israel to launch its ground invasion of the densely populated Gaza and easier for them to eventually occupy and take over Gaza allowing for Israeli settlers to fill the void after reconstruction efforts if Hamas/PIJ is overthrown.

4. Israel's bombing campaign in Gaza has so far killed 1,800+ & wounded 7,300+ as well as displaced 423,000+ Gazans


5. 30+ Palestinians have also been killed and 600+ injured in the West Bank due to settler violence and the violent actions of the IDF/Israeli police 


6. During their latest bombing campaign in Gaza, Israel has killed 500+ children & 270+ women so far



7. Israel has destroyed entire neighborhoods and sections of Gaza

8. Israel has dropped 6,000+ bombs in just a few days of fighting and unlike most Palestinian rockets, these bombs hit Gaza every time


9. Israel has bombed apartment buildings/complexes, mosques, UNRWA schools, hospitals, refugee camps, etc


10. Israel even bombed two of Syria's major airports putting them out of service simply to send a message to its rivals. This is what terrorists do.


11. Lies are being spread that Hamas beheaded babies in Israel despite there being no evidence of this with even the White House being forced to walk back comments. Such atrocity propaganda is only meant to ignite ppl and make the Palestinians look like monsters who deserve what's happening to them right now. This reminds me of the Nayirah testimony in which false testimony was given that accused Iraq of killing babies during the early months of the Gulf War.

12. After ordering a mass exodus of Northern Gaza, Israel hit convoys of ppl who were fleeing killing 70+ ppl most of which were children and women. 

13. Israel also bombed an area with reporters killing a Reuters reporter and wounding several more including two Al Jazeera reporters.


I am not trying to suggest what Hamas did is correct but what Israel is doing right now is also far from ok

225,17a8dlo,2023-10-17,conspiracy,Israeli airstrike destroys Gaza hospital & predictably they placed the blame upon the Palestinians,"Today, Oct 17, 2023, an Israeli launched airstrike most likley hit a hospital in Gaza that claimed the lives of hundreds of Gazans. Thousands were in and or near that hospital seeking shelter from Israeli attacks. 

It’s unclear, exactly what time it occurred but according to the Israeli military at 6:59pm (3:59 GMT) there were reports of an explosion at the hospital. The Al Jazeera recording took place at 18:49 aka 6:49pm. According to the BBC, the explosion at the hospital happened at around 19:00 local time on Tuesday. 

Whether it was done intentionally, accidently or while responding to Palestinian rocket fire is unknown. 

Predictably, Israel quickly laid the blame upon a misfired PIJ rocket. How do we know it wasn't an errant Israeli missile either from a drone or fighter jet? 

Plus, as mentioned above Israel blamed PIJ, not Hamas. Yet Israeli apologists like the American Jewish Committee aka AJC  site Hamas' rockets/attacks as being responsible. The two groups are not the same and have separate arsenals of weapons. 

There is word that Hamas fired an R-160/M-302 rocket at Hafia. This rocket is heavier in terms of weight but it was fired by Hamas, not PIJ. Plus, although it was fired on the same day as the hospital attack, the exact timing is unknown and Hamas claims that they shelled Hafia with it. Furthermore, Qassam Brigades, the armed wing of Palestinian Islamist group Hamas said on Monday it shelled the northern Israeli city of Haifa with an R-160 rocket. The hospital was hit on Tuesday according to the BBC & the hospital is close to Southern Israel so this R-160 rocket attack would have no need to fly over or near to the attacked hospital if it was striking a target in Northern Israel. 

The Israelis are just trying to sow confusion and deflect blame.

However, if you watch the video of the attack upon the hospital which was gelocated by WAPO you can tell that it was a very powerful strike with a huge blast/impact radius 

PIJ/Hamas launched rockets which are usually Qassem rockets although not always do not pack a punch like that. They are not as powerful. They can probably destroy a car or a room but not a hospital.

They cannot inflict that much damage. 

Also judging from the video, the impact including the sound, damage, etc suggests that it was a very heavy bomb like a JDAM or similar munition, not a Palestinian rocket which tend to be lighter.

A misfired rocket could have literally hit anything but it precisely hits the hospital.

The al-Ahli Arab Hospital is located in Gaza’s Old City between the Shujaiya and Zeitoun neighbourhoods in Gaza City. Gaza City is the site of some of the most frequent bombarding by Israel.

Israel was also making demands/threats at hospitals according to the MSF. For example, on Oct 13, 2023, MSF reported that Israel told them to evacuate a hospital in Gaza

Judging by the video, it sounds like a single airstrike hitting the target, not a barrage of rockets. 

It seems very precise aka targeted. 

Although there has been misfires before, no single Palestinian rocket has ever killed that many ppl and did that much damage ever, not in Israel and not in Palestine.

Israel is known to blame the Palestinians for its airstrikes especially if they end up hitting sensitive locations 

Israeli officials even deleted a video on a post claiming Palestinians were responsible for the hospital strike because the time stamp was off.

In another post, an Israeli official even claimed that they hit a hospital they said was being used by Hamas.

There is also a video of an Al Jazeera livestream being circulated showing what appears to be a rocket flying through the sky before appearing to malfunction or explode in mid air. Several seconds later, another much larger explosion is seen/heard somewhere below. This video was not geolocated. They are suggesting that this single rocket or shrapnel from it or another rocket not seen in this video is responsible for the massive explosion but this makes no sense. Shrapnel can't cause such a huge explosion and neither can a single Palestinian rocket. Although this video was cited as ""proof"" that it was a Palestinian rocket that hit the hospital by the IDF & Israeli sympathizers, it actually proves nothing. 

If it truly was a Palestinian rocket being launched from within Gaza, Israeli radars should have triggered alarms but they did not.

All Israel does is deny its wrongdoings, attempts to justify them or deflects blame upon the Palestinians. 

They denied using white phosphorus. They didnt accept responsibility for the recent attack upon journalists in Lebanon. They denied attacking the hospital. They denied lighting up convoys of fleeing ppl in Gaza. 

Israel killed Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh and originally denied this too. Even after it was found out that they did, they never charged the soldiers behind it.

Israel has targeted hospitals, UN schools, journalists, refugee camps, mosques, etc in the past as well

There have been over 115 attacks on healthcare in Palestine since the start of the conflict on October 7, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).
At least 20 hospitals in Gaza City and North Gaza and one hospital in Rafah have received repeated evacuation orders from the Israeli military, and 77 attacks have been documented in the West Bank, 43 of these attacks have caused physical violence to health teams.

Even in the remote chance that it was a misfired Palestinian rocket and not an Israeli airstrike, it still doesn't matter. Israel is ultimately to blame for all the violence in this conflict because all of this is happening in the first place b/c Israel created Hamas and b/c of Israeli aggression, occupation, apartheid, violations of international law/human rights, the blockade, etc.

It could have also been an interception of Palestinian rockets gone wrong or Israel could have hacked the rocket systems so that they misfire.

Furthermore, Israel could have used rockets similar to the ones in Hamas or PIJ's arsenal to blame them for said attack.

They say not to trust the Hamas controlled Health Ministey but then why should we trust the Israeli controlled IDF?

US officials have said that the hospital attack was likley due to a PIJ rocket misfire as Biden visits Israel therefore repeating Israeli claims but why should we believe Israel's top ally? 

Ppl ask why would Israel do this or they outright say that Israel wouldn't do this. Except that's what Israel has been doing now and in the past. They have indiscriminately bombed civilians in Gaza for years. They have bombed mosques, clinics, schools, hospitals, apartments, refugee camps, etc and then simply say Hamss is using human shields and Hamas was using those facilities aka shift the blame upon them.",Puzzlebrain21,t2_b5n15jrl,0.41,0,8

231,17pkj0t,2023-11-07,conspiracy,Israel's Nefarious Plans for Palestine,"In all of these decades, Israel has never agreed to a two state solution

&#x200B;

They have done the opposite of allowing for a Palestinian state to be created with their illegal settlement building, constant violation of Palestinian sovereignty, continuing their occupation, maintaining control over the West Bank/East Jerusalem, blockading Gaza & as Netanyahu has said before publically, continuing their goal of dividing the Palestinians 

&#x200B;

Those who claim that if Hamas is destroyed, then a Palestinian state will finally be created are horribly wrong. Hamas was a creation of Israel and Israel has been occupying and violating Palestine long before Hamas. Even if Hamas were to disappear tomorrow, Israel will continue its occupation/violation of Palestine rather than coming to the table of peace 

&#x200B;

If Israel has continued its bullying of Palestine even with armed resistance all of these years, what do you think will happen if a scenario were to unfold where armed resistance is no longer an option for Palestine? What do you think will happen if the Palestinians are disarmed? 

&#x200B;

This is similar to the gun debate in the US. If the citizenry of America were to be disarmed, they will be completely helpless to the increasing tyranny of the gov. This is what may happen to the Palestinians if Israel were to succeed. This is what Hitler strived to achieve by disarming the Jewish population of Germany

&#x200B;

If Israel were to succeed in Gaza one or more of the following scenarios could unfold, all of which will be bad for Palestine and their statehood- 

&#x200B;

\-Gaza's territory may be reduced with a possible buffer zone being established in Gaza. This buffer zone may even include the indefinite siege of Gaza City and the prolonged separation of North Gaza from South Gaza 

&#x200B;

\-As Netanyahu has already stated publically, Israel will maintain security control over Gaza indefinetly & Gallant also said that by the end of the war, the IDF will have full freedom of action in Gaza aka the occupation will continue

&#x200B;

\-Israel will eventually annex Gaza like they've done with East Jerusalem 

&#x200B;

\-Even without actual annexation, they can slowly annex Gaza as they've done with the West Bank by building illegal settlements in Gaza and then proceeding to settle Israelis in Gaza as they did up until 2005 within Gaza. They can do so under the guise of rebuilding Gaza

&#x200B;

\-Even if they don't outright annex Gaza, they will strive to maintain ultimate control over Gaza as they're doing to this day with the West Bank. Israel may try to pull this off via a publicity stunt in which they ""handover"" Gaza to the Ramallah, West Bank based Palestinian ""government"" Fatah aka PLO currently led by Mahmoud Abbas. This will largely be symbolic with Palestine becoming a puppet/client state of Israel with ultimate control held by Israel but this time with Gaza included 

&#x200B;

\-Israel may try to induce a new Nakba aka catastrophe aka an ethnic cleansing aka another great displacement of Palestinians but this time targeting the population of Gaza. They can do this by not only creating terrible living conditions in Gaza but maintaining them thus making Gaza uninhabitable. They can try to limit or outright stop aid/reconstruction. They can also use humanitarian corridors to remove ppl from Gaza and place them in tent cities/refugee camps in neighboring Arab countries and then deny re-entry. Acceptance of Gazan refugees can expand outside of the Arab world which may even create another refugee crisis in Europe/elsewhere. They can strive to achieve this by incentivizing countries like Egypt, Jordan, etc with debt forgiveness, military aid, oil deals such as those involving the Gaza Marine for example, etc. Apparently, Israel has already tried to bribe Egypt with debt forgiveness via the IMF/World Bank 

&#x200B;

\-Gaza may be left in political disarray with multiple factions battling for power similar to Libya if no one steps up to govern Gaza. This can result in a divided, destabilized Gaza

&#x200B;

\-Israel may use the typical American military excuse of a ""long war"" to continue a military occupation of Gaza for many months or even years especially since this war could easily become a protracted war of attrition in Gaza

&#x200B;

\-As mentioned by the US, a multinational military coalition may move into Gaza consisting of Arab only or a mixture of Arab/western forces. This scenario will probably only happen with Israeli coordination/permission therefore Israel would maintain control/favourable conditions for itself 

&#x200B;

Ultimately, the goal of the Zionists is to destroy Palestinian statehood once and for all, remove as many Palestinians from the area as possible, establish a Greater Israel by scooping up all of Palestinian territory for itself and eventually build the Third Temple on the Temple Mount",Puzzlebrain21,t2_b5n15jrl,0.38,0,13

236,17akhjh,2023-10-18,conspiracy,The True Face Of Hamas: Terrorism As a Business.,"For the top leaders of Hamas, terrorism is a business.

Most of the Hamas leaders live in Qatar, in multimillion dollar mansions in Doha, driving luxury cars with Iran and CCP providing additional funds.

These leaders aren't your fanatical terrorists that strap explosives to their bodies, they have long since lost their wild aura. They were designer clothes and gold rimmed glasses.  They look like a rich person you might pass by on the street, they own Bugatti luxury cars.

In 2015, Iran (Hamas's largest donor) began to have some quarrels. In a fit of anger Iran cut off Hamas monthly aid of 20 million dollars. It also exposed the truth about the extravagant lifestyles of Hamas's senior officials.

After seeing the true face of Hamas the Palestinian people were upset and the whole country was angry. People in Gaza even took the streets against Hamas because Hamas is the force that actually controls Gaza. The Palestinian people wanted to call for national elections to be held as soon as possible to replace Hamas.

Hamas saw the situation was not good. They immediately ordered their subordinates to hurry up and launch a new round of terrorist attacks on Israel causing many Palestinian civilian causalities in exchange for the support of it's 'big brothers' such as Iran, Russia and the Chinese Communist Party.

In the eyes of the extremists Hamas becomes a national hero again. The way Hamas views it is this, when I fight the world calls me a terrorist organization. If I don't fight all my funding from those above (Iran, CCP, Russia) is immediately cut.

If you are a senior member of Hamas this is a dire situation.

&#x200B;

In the West bank the party that controls it is a more moderate government called Fatah, it's current leader is Abbas. This government is seen by the U.S, Europe and even Israel as being a legitimate government and funding from other countries are given to this government.

But Hamas, like the wolf that it is also covets money. Remember, the top executives of Hamas are making a very good living from this organization. To maintain their extravagant lifestyle they have to find a sponsor that is willing to still give you money. Currently the largest financial sponsors are Iran, a handful of Arab countries and the CCP.

Hamas has to behave according to these 'donors' wishes, especially to the wishes of Iran. If Iran wants Hamas to create chaos, Hamas as no choice but to engage in terrorism.  The leader of Hamas in Qatar calls his henchmen in Gaza and tells them they have to incite terrorism attacks so that the funding Iran from won't dry up.

This is the basic 'business model' of Hamas.

&#x200B;

After Trump took office in 2016, he adopted a very pragmatic and comprehensive Middle East policy for Iran, Syria and other countries. Some he won over, others he sanctioned heavily. He actively bought the Arab would and Israel into good relations. For a time, both side of the Jordan River were silent.

Under the light of peace the people of Gaza lived a peaceful live for several years. Peace is a good thing for ordinary people but it's a very bad thing for 'careerists'.

The first half of this year relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia were warming rapidly. The two governments not only reached a multi faceted reconciliation but also started sending special envoys to each other.

There is one country who sees this and hates it in his heart. Which country?

Iran.

Once Saudi Arabia (like Egypt) becomes friends with Israel then Iran's diplomatic situation becomes more passive. The solution? It's time to let Hamas out of it's cage again. Iran desperately needs to pass off a new set of Palestinian-Israeli conflicts forcing Saudi Arabia to once again alienate Israel.

After Hamas launched a terrorist attack on Gaza on October the 7th the Saudi's government's first position is to firmly support Palestine. But notice,the Saudi government supports Palestine but not Hamas. Saudi Arabia being a Muslim country must side with the Arab world.

Iran rejoiced and their goal was achieved.

On the Other hand, the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) also has deep hopes that by once again messing up the situation in the middle east this will help to contain the United States and it's allies. The CCP can do bad things under the covers while the world is busy with this crisis.

A: ChatGPT

The Israel-Palestine conflict is a deeply complex and long-standing issue with deep historical, political, and emotional roots. There is no easy or one-size-fits-all solution, and any attempt to address it requires a comprehensive and inclusive approach that takes into account the needs and concerns of both Israelis and Palestinians. While I cannot provide a definitive solution, I can outline some general principles that could be part of a potential resolution:

Two-State Solution: A two-state solution remains a widely discussed framework for resolving the conflict. This would involve the establishment of an independent and sovereign Palestinian state alongside Israel, with mutually agreed-upon borders. Negotiations would need to address key issues like the status of Jerusalem, borders, and the rights of refugees.

Negotiations: Both parties should engage in direct, meaningful, and sustained negotiations without preconditions. The involvement of the international community, including the United Nations, can play a facilitating role in these talks.

Security: Any agreement must ensure the security and safety of both Israelis and Palestinians. This may involve the demilitarization of the future Palestinian state and robust security measures.

Borders and Land Swaps: A final settlement should involve mutually agreed-upon borders, potentially with land swaps that allow Israel to retain some of the major settlement blocks in exchange for equivalent land given to the Palestinians.

Jerusalem: The issue of Jerusalem is highly sensitive, as both Israelis and Palestinians consider it their capital. A creative solution may involve shared sovereignty or international administration of Jerusalem, with access and religious rights guaranteed for all.

Refugees: Addressing the issue of Palestinian refugees is critical. This may include compensation, resettlement, or return, in accordance with the wishes of the refugees themselves.

Economic Development: A peace agreement should include provisions for economic development in the region, which can help build trust and provide opportunities for both Israelis and Palestinians.

International Support: The international community, particularly neighboring countries and major powers, should be actively involved in supporting and monitoring the peace process.

People-to-People Initiatives: Grassroots efforts to foster understanding and cooperation between Israelis and Palestinians can contribute to long-term peace. These initiatives can include joint educational programs, cultural exchanges, and business partnerships.

Reconciliation: Reconciliation efforts should be an integral part of any peace agreement, addressing historical grievances and fostering a sense of shared future for both nations.

It's important to recognize that achieving a lasting resolution to the Israel-Palestine conflict is extremely challenging and requires the willingness of both parties to make difficult compromises. The road to peace is fraught with obstacles, but a just and lasting solution is in the interest of both Israelis and Palestinians, as well as the broader international community.",stevie_j,t2_6auge,0.31,0,6

Muslims will face the same, when they see their holy sites (Mecca, etc) that are supposedly under divine protection being blown to pieces, and their countries being blown up and made obsolete, this too will cast doubt, as well as other revelations about Islam that will be made public.

When non Muslims and non Christians see the massacre that can occur in the name of religion, they will be put off of religion completely.

He later went on to become the dictator of Pakistan. Why is nobody angry about Jordan's treatment of these present-day Palestinians?

**ISRAEL CUTTING OFF WATER AND ELECTRICITY**Did you know that only 10% of Gazan water supply comes from Israel? The water which they have shut off is only 10% of regular Gazan supply. What about the other 90%?? It was Hamas job, but they took the water pipes donated by EU, dug them out of the ground, cut them into pieces, and used them as housing for homemade rockets! They are the reason for the humanitarian crisis, Not Israel. Israel only supplies 50% of electricity to Gaza. What about the other 50%?? Hamas is responsible for the ongoing Gaza humanitarian crisis.

**LACK OF DEVELOPMENT**Gaza gets more aid, collectively, from neighboring and faraway countries in the EU, adding up to more than Israel gets from US/UK. It's a very small piece of land, albeit with over 2 million residents. Hamas (the leadership elected by Gazans in 2006) has not bothered to build any infrastructure, educate the people, or build a beautiful society, which the whole world would have supported, to bring Palestine up to modern standards of living. They could have been an IT hub, that is one of the lowest-overhead things you can do to improve your economy. All the funding money has been funneled into aggression on the Israelis, for which the Gazans suffer (blockages, security checks etc), while the Hamas leadership (with their families) lives in comfort in other countries at a 5-star level of living.

Long story short, initially I have wanted to know more about the Israel-Palestine conflict. Thus turned on and rewatched [Madonna's Eurovision 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG3WkiL0d_U) satanic performance on Youtube. Counted the number of stairs in the video. Got 27. Then tried to find out the meaning behind number 27 in freemasonary. Found this source: [Scottish Rite wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Rite).

The 27th degree mason in northern jurisdiction is called ""Knight of Jerusalem"".  A reference to the ongoing war? There are flags of Israel and Palestine in Madonna's performance in the video too.

Anyway, I've noticed southern jurisdiction 27th degree mason is called ""Knight of the Sun"". Did some googling and [this](https://dc.fandom.com/wiki/Knights_of_the_Sun_(Prime_Earth)) is the first result. Quote:

>What is a Knight of the Sun? Their members are motivated by a belief in Batman's danger to society rather than any material gain. The Knights of the Sun are an organization who work for the Arkham Knight.

It's far fetched but maybe Matthew's death was some kind of a satanic sacrifice with a connection to the Israeli war?

Also, he was 54 years old when he died. 54/2 = 27.

Moreover, I've learned that the number 27 might have some kind of a connection to planet Saturn. Saturn year - it is the time when you must define yourself for yourself.

since 1948 they were treated the same way jews were back in nazi germany.
Palestinians are humiliated every day.
I've seen israeli soldiers shoot Palestinians kids, bulldoze homes for settlers, break a kids arm, beat Palestinians senseless, but i have yet to see proof of so called beheaded babies. But i have seen beheaded Palestinians babies, (sabra and chatila camps) and take a wild guess if israel had something to do with it.

It is easy for us to feel bad for israelis when they look like us, middle class modern people, while Palestinians having everything taken from them and forced into ghettos, look different, look weird.

If a bullied kid in the US goes and shoots up their school because mental heath issues, why do you expect an entire population bullied into no future, no life, like animals in a zoo, and you wonder why they fought back, why they killed when they got the chance to.

Revenge is a human aspect. Go live in gaza where no law protects u, and then tell me you wouldn't hate them.

The hate people feel towards Palestinians for killing civilians is the same hate Palestinians have towards israelis for the very same reason, killing the innocent. The only difference is that you see Palestinians do it in person, which is a horrible sight for us civilians. But it's easier to see a building collapse with no victims in sight. Killing is killing.

You can't take things in vaccum because then Palestinians seem to just be violent, but the media does that. This conflict has been ongoing since 1948. And as for the dude who posted that arabs cant live amongst themselves, neither can europeans(russian vs ukraine), nor can americans. (Higest gun violence). Even in the richest nation the so-called nation of freedom, americans kill americans daily, mass shootings happen daily, one could even use the words in this dudes post and say its ingrained in their DNA to be violent. 

We are afraid to call Israel out because holocaust, they are victims and yes true. But what did the Palestinians do to them, why are they being punished because of german.. no European crimes againstthe jewish population? How is that fair? How is this right?

Would you also call the jewish ghetto uprising terroism? Absurd i know, but all this Nazi like rhetoric from pro israeli people, human animals, arabs naturally violent, just goes to show that you are a nazi minded individual with a different flag.  
""give em hell"" a quote from our favorite humanist psychologist jordan peterson. To him i say, if twitter was wnough to spiral you downwards into depression, is it difficult to believe that people placed in open air prison, living in the really bad conditions, 85% unemployment, average age to be 18 (i bet because they dont live long enough being killed by famine or bombings) the entire world abandoned them as the Armenians were in nagorno karabakh, as the uighers in china, north koreas, kurds, and god knows how many more are cast into the pits of hell in this world from birth. Some people are dealt a bad hand in life, as were the jews in 1939 germany. 
With all that, he says give them hell, Mr. Peterson, if you refuse to see them as human, and understand the psychological factors that make people do what Palestinians did, then you dont deserve to be called a psychologist. Is it that hard to understand? 
In Palestine as in many of these oppressed people around the world, the P in PTSD doesnt exist. Or it stands for perpetual, never ending. That is not right. As human beings that is not right to accept and justify. 
 I am in shock at how evil the world is. When ukraine was invaded, i thought the west was a force of good. But then their media consistently lies then retracts news about beheaded babies, knowing it would spread, and they get to maintain their credibility. That along with many things showed me once and for all that there is no good force in this world. Its just a bunch of evils fighting other evils, and none are the lesser. So this is our world. Practice cognitive dissonance and choose between 1 of 2 choices, either you wave the flag of the evil government that gives you the illusion of freedom or you go to the evil governments that give you the illusion of resistance against tyranny.

I will choose to be naive, ignorant, because i am powerless. Let corporations ruin everything for the environment, the economy, then get a blank check by the government to bail them out because thats how capitalism works. Let your tech industries make you addicted and destroy humanity, let the food industry sell you sugar loaded food, let the medical industry over price their products, let the wars go on and on, let the media shape ur reality, let everything's price go up but not your salary, let the rich exploit and get richer with legal loopholes and let the rest suffer. Dont forget to wave your country's flag, and cheer on one military power to crush poor people because they are just slightly more poor than you, how dare they not be born privilegedlike i was? Grind, and one day you will make it. 
And the other side, you are poor, you have no rights, but your side is fighting the others imperialist side. By oppressing our people calling anyone who disagrees a spy of the other side. Let your people live in poverty while your leader lives in a billion dollar home. Let your rights be taken away if you show no support, let your coutry turn into a dictatorial dystopia, you are after all the resistance!

Already since 7/10 people have come out with pro-Palestine demonstrations and deny what happened on 7/10, people who say look at pictures and then who show it is AI, say that women were rap*ed and with proof but even then they don't believe even from women's organizations, they see what a lie that all Israelis rape. Women who say they were raped are not supposed to be believed, especially if there is proof? A rocket fell in a hospital in Israel and luckily no one was injured, but no one at all talked about it either, contrary to what happened with the hospital in Gaza that it wasn't Israel's fault, the same with schools, kindergartens but if is in Israel no one care. I see celebrities only posting about the poor in Gaza without saying a word about what happened in Israel, and if they talk about the Jews “I am against anti-Semitism and I am with you Jews outside of Israel”, I saw a Jewish woman from the USA on TikTok who said that I don't want to answer about Israel now, I want to be with my fellow Jews to cry for our brother and sisters and people say “but there were still poorer people in Gaza”. I understand that they are more dangerous, but are we not allowed to cry? We must also not be sad just because in Gaza they are poorer? People who shout from the river to the sea don't understand that this means a second holocaust? People say it's about a humane section, but what they did to us is not humane? Because Hamas hides behind civilians it has immunity and Israel is not allowed to respond? In Israel there are more than half of the world's Jews and for people to say such things is like saying to all the Jews (and then there are the Jews who stand with Hamas and cause more problems for the rest of the Jews in the world). I had to vent because this is how it feels to me that ours do not deserve protection, that our lives are not important, that our children are not as important as the children in Gaza. But one thing I have understood, there is a saying in Hebrew, “it is not from the love of Mordechai, but from the hatred of Haman”, and it feels exactly the same, it is not from the love of the Palestinians, it is from the hatred of the Jews",Necessary_Actuary595,t2_saiku3ad,0.92,436,170

277,17u41d7,2023-11-13,Israel,Anti-Zionism is just Arab settler-colonialism.,"What we're witnessing right now from the conniving, Jew-bashing 'Free Palestine' mobs and their 'anti-colonialist' rhetoric is a gaslighting campaign of the most epic proportions imaginable, eclipsing even holocaust denial in its brazen slander, falsehood and scope. It both amazes and infuriates me that even on the Pro-Israeli or 'moderate' side, most people are so misinformed on the region's history that they simply take Arab Supremacist propaganda and semantic tricks at face value without fully deconstructing it. 

A lot of those who haven't *extensively* delved into the geopolitical timeline of this territory on our side, not to mention the cynical hypocrites on the other side, think for example that the only counterweight for the Nakba is the exodus of Jews from Arab-ruled nations outside Mandatory Palestine or that the Jewish sovereignty of 2,000 years ago is the *only* reason why Jews had the moral license to immigrate and seek self-determination in British Mandatory Palestine.

We seriously have to stop letting Islamo-fascists and Arab Supremacists ( An ideology dating back to Amin Al-Husseini ) get away with their subversive narrative of events *before Israel's establishment in 1948*. Hamas, PLO fanatics, and their supporters all over the Arab and Western world did not just go too far and do an 'oopsie' to 'fourth-generation Israeli settlers' who 'stole their lands' by killing and kidnapping children. 

Israel proper is not 'their' land, it was not the land of their ancestors *at any point* in history, they are not 'the colonized natives' transposed from American history by ignorant self-centered college students attempting to project their own guilt on Jews. What they truly are is merely *the latest manifestation of a long succession of colonizing, imperialist Arab invaders who have for centuries upon centuries stolen actual indigenous people's lands, butchered them, abused them as second-class citizens and then tried to exterminate us again as soon as we returned to our homeland while screaming bloody murder in a display of sheer hypocrisy*. 

Let's break down all the components of this fraud into their respective parts so you can understand exactly how tangled this web of lies is:

**The conflation of definitions in the term 'Palestinians' and 'Palestine'**

This is a fairly obvious one but still enough to fool the lowest IQ echelons of the Anti-Zionist camp. Today, the moniker 'Palestinian' is colloquially used to refer to inhabitants of the West Bank and Gaza, as well as *exclusively* to Arab citizens of Israel by the global left. In some people's minds, this creates a false dichotomy where, since the title of 'British Mandatory Palestine' or 'Historic Palestine' has the word 'Palestine' in the name, then that retroactively makes everyone called a 'Palestinian' the true inheritor of the land and anyone who is called 'Israeli' or 'Jew' is some kind of foreign intruder.

But that's not what 'Palestinian' meant before 1948, when there weren't any 1967 borders or Israeli-Arabs. It simply meant anyone who lived in Mandatory Palestine and held a Palestinian passport, *including every single Jewish Zionist present there*. As Golda Meir famously said in an interview to a flabbergasted reporter - ""I *am* a Palestinian"". While Jews never really appreciated identifying themselves by the name assigned to the area by Roman colonizers as an insult to their people for self-evident reasons, legally and practically speaking they were completely equivalent to any other Palestinian. Therefore whenever we speak of 'Palestinian', we must distinguish ( As the PLO's own founding charter does and the Arab Higher Committee has done in 1948 ) between *Palestinian-Arabs* and other ethnicities.

""But aha!"" will say the Anti-Zionist, most of them only immigrated to the area in the past 20 or 50 years or whatever, therefore they aren't *real* Palestinians, those filthy immigrants! Don't worry, we'll get to that *incredibly ironic* sentiment from 'Progressive leftists' in a moment.

**The nativity tale of Palestinian-Arabs** 

According to Anti-Zionists and the majority of Arabs, immigrating to historic Palestine from another country or territory and then proceeding to found settlements ( AKA villages, towns ) on it is the most heinous crime imaginable and the core of what it means to be a 'settler-colonialist' nation, especially if you dare to vie for self-determination afterwards too. Unfortunately for them, it seems they only consider it depraved when done by Jews, because that is *precisely* how a huge chunk if not most Palestinian-Arabs found their way into 'Historic Palestine' to begin with, all the way up to 1948. 

https://www.rslissak.com/content/arab-muslim-waves-immigration-palestine-land-israel-drrivka-shpak-lissak/
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramallah#Ottoman_era
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nablus#Classical_antiquity
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jund_Filastin#Population
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandatory_Palestine#Jewish_immigration

There have been migration waves of non-Jews and of neighboring individuals into the territory in almost every century since it's been depleted of the bulk of its native Jewish and Samaritan population, some more violent than others, some as literal colonies of foreign empires, and the two biggest Palestinian cities in the West Bank are literally 'colonial settlements' to put it in their terms. In fact, between 1920 and 1948, the British census counted *30k non-Jewish immigrants arriving at the Mandate*. Sure, in this specific period of time, Jewish immigration was much greater, and yet all of those 30k Arabs would automatically be considered 'rightful native land-owners' simply by virtue of their non-Jewishness, and immigration at large is only vile colonialism from 1880 onwards but never beforehand, I wonder why? It's almost as if Arabs are considered inherently superior and more entitled to 'lebensraum' than Jews.

**The 'peaceful co-existence' between Arabs and Jews**

According to Anti-Zionist propaganda, the 'native' Arab-Muslim population has coexisted in absolute harmony with the undesirables such as Jews, Samaritans and others whom they so graciously permitted to live under a dictatorial ethnocentric Arab yoke, until the evil Zionists showed up and ruined everything. But interestingly enough, before the Zionist movement even picked up steam during the times of Ottoman Syria, the region and 'Historic Palestine' in particular experienced a series of massacres committed almost exclusively by Arabs and Muslims, the 'oppressed natives', against 'less-native' minorities such as Jews, Samaritans and Maronite. I was under the impression that Arab Muslims only massacre people out of frustration with colonialism, so I wonder what prompted all of those? Perhaps they were getting too bored with their own colonialism?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_massacres_in_Ottoman_Syria

And then we are told that the only time a Palestinian-Arab ever kills a Jew is because they've been justifiably radicalized by a higher death count among Palestinian-Arabs and subjugation by the IDF, and yet before the IDF or even the Jewish paramilitaries existed, before a single Jew killed a single Arab, Arabs have been committing the very first massacres in Mandatory Palestine since the 1920's, including beheading babies and cutting open pregnant mothers according to the account of the British police superintendent. I guess some things never change.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_killings_and_massacres_in_Mandatory_Palestine

But hey, maybe those Jews simply had it coming? I wonder how *another* ethnic minority which has remained present in tiny numbers on the Land of Israel for thousands of years, the Samaritans, have been faring under the gentle guidance of the Muslim Arab liberators?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samaritans#Ottoman_rule

Hmm, what's that? Massacres and forced conversions, again? Most Samaritans defecting to Israel and joining the IDF after Israel's establishment?? WTF! Why would such an ancient native group which can trace its legacy for longer than most Palestinian-Arabs welcome a  bunch of European settlers as long-lost brothers and willingly participate in the Zionist project?? Don't they know who the REAL natives are? I guess not.

**Arab 'Blood and Soil' entitlement**

You may have heard Anti-Zionists screeching about how 

>""THEY deserve THEIR LAND back!!!"" 
>""How would you feel if someone stole half of YOUR HOUSE out of nowhere?"", 
>""Palestinians want THEIR country back""

THEIR house, THEIR land, THEIR country, who is 'they'? It's not just Palestinians living in the modern Palestinian Territories in the West Bank and Gaza, it clearly doesn't apply to Palestinian Jews because they are the 'land thieves', it doesn't even apply to Mizrahi Jews... hmmm, mysteriously the only demographic being referred to here is *non-Jewish Arabs*, wherever they may be. Don't you know, anyone with Gentile Arab DNA is a 'rightful land owner' between the river and the sea, including those 30k Arab immigrants between 1920 and 1948,  and everyone with Jewish DNA is a land thief, sounds completely historically accurate! So progressive!

And where exactly are those 'Arab lands'? Is it just their actual houses, farms, private property? Hmm, nope. Is it Arab-majority towns and cities? Hmm, wrong again. Oh wait, I know this one - It's that artificial shape drawn by a British pencil on a chunk of the Ottoman Empire which doesn't even align with the administrative borders of Ottoman Syria! That's right, every single piece of uninhabited desert, forest, swamp, hill or plains encompassed by the British line is the ancestral birthright of the Arab race, and the Arab race alone. *The soil itself* will only accommodate Arab blood ( Sounds familiar? ). Why is it all specifically Arab, you asked? Aren't there some Jewish or Samaritan dunes and forests within the British Mandate too somewhere? Well that my friend is an insidious form of Zionist thinking.

You see, the British Empire is both legitimate and illegitimate at the same time, it's a Schrodinger's sovereign. When they draw a bunch of lines on the former Ottoman Empire resulting in a territory which contains an Arab demographic majority, then suddenly all of those Arabs who were previously just provincial residents in a given town or city now 'rightfully own' every other piece of land located inside those lines. They're lucky that the British didn't conquer China and add it to Mandatory Palestine or else those lands would belong to the 'Native Chinese majority', or you could stretch the borders over half of Egypt and claim they should never get independence because ""That's not what the Egyptian native majority of the Mandate wants!"".

But when the British allow for Jewish immigration, just as the Ottomans or Caliphates allowed for Arab immigration, and then take out the pencil to divide the Mandate into two, suddenly the British are no longer legitimate and have no moral authority to draw any boundaries, only Arab monarchs and clerics have the moral authority to do so, yet strangely enough the Mandate borders 'from the river to the sea' magically remain legitimate and everything inside them 'belongs to Arabs'. You see, [everything inside this map](https://th.bing.com/th/id/R.67c740245f9300452a25c6c10ced7522?rik=Gi5nPKfN0FtuCw&riu=http%3a%2f%2fwww.salom.com.tr%2fuploads%2fimages%2f9112018paaVTZ6apaEuEY51.png&ehk=pZ8%2fpiAW0W1%2fvOdTaVBj%2bpYY5mVNYUg5RknMRm4XMwM%3d&risl=&pid=ImgRaw&r=0) which might be erroneously labelled as 'Private Jewish land', 'Unsettled State Land', and 'Unregisted, undeveloped Land' is actually just Stolen Arab Land because if Arabs decide something is theirs, then that's the reality, just as it worked with Arab Imperialism throughout the Middle-East.",Rentasion,t2_msw165qob,0.91,402,109

I think that us Israelis have internalized and normalized, what looks like nobody outside of Israel grasps, this distinction needs to be something that is mentioned at the beginning of every Israel - Palestine debate

***Let's take a look at other famous conflicts -***

Ukraine - If Ukraine losses, Ukraine losses its democracy and become a puppet to Russia, Ukrainians still living, but under Russian indirect rule

Taiwan - If China attacks Taiwan, and Taiwan losses, Taiwan losses its identity and becomes part of China, Taiwanese still living, but as Chinese

South Korea - If South Korea losses to North Korea, South Koreans become part of a unified Korea - South Koreans continue to live, but under worse conditions in a brutal dictatorship

India <-> Pakistan (Kashmir) - The winner gets a hold of Kashmir region and the population there becomes citizens of the winner, obviously, they continue to live

***Now, let's look at Israel's enemies -***

Iran \-   [Israel should be wiped off map, says Iran's president](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/oct/27/israel.iran)

Hamas \- [Hamas' original charter says](https://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/hamas.asp)

""The Day of Judgment will not come about until Moslems fight Jews and kill them. Then, the Jews will hide behind rocks and trees, and the rocks and trees will cry out: 'O Moslem, there is a Jew hiding behind me, come and kill him.'""

(Article 7)

&#x200B;

Looking back at Israel's old wars, where armies of 7 armies ganged up on Israel, in times where they could temporarily capture Israeli villages, they killed every single person living in it

""From November 29, 1947, Kfar Etzion was under siege and cut off from Jerusalem. On May 13, 1948, when the village surrendered, 127 Jewish inhabitants [were massacred](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kfar_Etzion_massacre) by local village irregulars, with the possible involvement of the [Arab Legion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Legion).[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gush_Etzion#cite_note-8) The other villages surrendered the next day. The inhabitants were taken prisoner and the homes were plundered and burned.[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gush_Etzion#cite_note-9)""

&#x200B;

In both regions of the Palestinian controlled territories they had 1 free elections (when other countries enforced it), which immediately turned into dictatorship (which throws the 'one state solution' out the window, as Israelis won't give up on their democracy \[don't mention the reforms... don't mention the reforms... don't mention the reforms...\])

In the first region Hamas was elected, which I spoke about above

In the second region Fatah is in control, who spends more than half of its budget on the Pay for Slay system, which is paying stipends to terrorists (or their families if they died while commiting Jihad), the more Israelis killed, the more money they earn

&#x200B;

I am sure this post won't survive long, so I am sorry for it being somewhat of a mess, if the m\*ds tell me that it won't be deleted, I will repost it with proper formatting, and more links,

Whatever you call yourself be it, Anti Zionist, Pro Palestinian, Pro whatever, when you support people, who openly claim that their objective is to kill millions of Jews, you are either an Anti Semite, or you have no idea what you support.

281,16hz4hl,2023-09-13,Israel,Jew Hatred Hosted at University of Pennsylvania," 

On September 22-24, while Jews are preparing to observe Yom Kippur, [the University of Pennsylvania will be hosting an event that contains several ""anti-Zionist activists""](https://www.algemeiner.com/2023/09/12/are-most-jews-evil-top-us-university-hosting-palestine-literature-festival-featuring-avid-anti-zionists/). While the event is billed as ""a celebration of Palestinian art and literature"", it is likely to be anything but.

One of the ""activists"" invited is Islamic University of Gaza professor Refaat Alareer, [who tweeted in 2018,](https://twitter.com/GileadIni/status/1470857056097902599) “Are most Jews evil? Of course they are.”

Another is Palestian researcher Salman Abu Sitta, who stated once that ""Jews were hated in Europe because they played a role in the destruction of the economy in some of the countries, so they would hate them."" He also has referred to Jews as [“ghetto-dwellers in Europe who came to take our land”](https://www.thejc.com/news/news/'antisemitic'-academic-to-give-balfour-lecture-to-mark-the-100-years-of-british-mandate-OC0mNSfQ4todvUFWBUTWn) and stated that ""only Jews are immune from … criticism"".

The executive director of the event, Susan Abulhawa, [stated that](https://aijac.org.au/op-ed/writers-festival-must-not-embrace-anti-semitic-hate/) after seven Jews were murdered in a shooting in Jerusalem, ""These people are vile. Armed human garbage. But I take comfort in knowing without a doubt that this colonial apartheid state will eventually be … wiped off the map.” She went on to say “Every Israeli, whether in a synagogue, a checkpoint, settlement, or shopping mall is a coloniser who came from foreign lands and kicked out the native inhabitants. They all serve in their racist colonial military. The whole country is one big, militarised tumour.”

The last ""activist"" of note is Roger Waters, who is not Palestinian so his ""art"" if you can call it that can hardly be described as Palestinian, but his politics are correct, so he's invited.

Once again, the evidence is clear, the Palestinian cause and anti-Semitism are hopelessly intertwined. The director of this event is a bigot towards Israelis and she clearly has no problem with inviting people with a history of anti-Semitic statements to her event. Coming off Abbas' latest anti-Semitic comments that went viral, anyone who wants to separate the Palestinian cause from anti-Semitism is having their work cut out for them.

But today, years later, after I did take the time and learn both Israel's and Palestine's history, I just can't explain how an Israeli can be pro Palestine for any reason other than absolute naivity, ignorance of history, or due to suicidal tendencies

There wasn't ever a popular Palestinian moderate faction that really accepted Israel existence and didn't see peace as a means to later destroy Israel (Arafat launched the 2nd intifada and Abbas runs the Pay for Slay system + they immidiatly became unpopular when they signed ""peace"" (if we can call it peace) with Israel) 

The Palestinians today (not Arabs in general, there are a ton of Arabs that identify as Israeli, they are our brothers and should be treated/regarded as such) are still mostly voting for parties who's members call for the destruction of Israel, be it in public, or behind closed doors

The most popular party among Palestinians in Gaza/West Bank is Hamas, who's charter calls for the death of all Jews (they don't bother with the anti Zionist BS, they literally say Jews) - which is also the reason why the West Bank is destined to become a Gaza 2.0,and a big reason why 2SS won't work

This one obviously doesn't represent every single Palestinian but - they don't share any of our values, be it on democracy, women rights, LGBT rights, minority rights etc

Not only is this was extremely unprofessional for the police officers, to start talking about politics in a stage where they should have been only talking about the situation and the measures they are taking in order that no one (on both sides) would get hurt like this again, they were also defending the perpetrator.
This is insane, that it’s okay for police officers that care more about stating where they are in the conflict and making their side seem good for the camera to be taking care of this case.
This is insane that people are going out of their way to defend the murderer.

The most Anti-Semitism I see is saying Holocaust Survivors or Ashkenazim shouldn't be in Israel. Attacking them, people I know, for daring to go to their homeland. The focus has really shifted to Ashkenazim in Arab anti-Semitism. As far as they are concerned, Ashkenazim are converts (not true, and frankly not an issue if they were) and fake Jews. Mizrahi Jews, as far as they are concerned, just don't exist, which is just aggravating for a whole 'nother set of reasons. These people were praying and speaking in Hebrew before Arabs were Muslim, what's the issue? Moving, like the ancestors of Palestinian Arabs did?

I know Holocaust Survivors which went to Israel, and I am on a college campus where a Holocaust Survivor I brought to speak about his experience who was an IDF veteran was harassed by ""Palestinians"" (or people who said they were). It's ridiculous.",911UsernameWasTaken,t2_ff7dfhe0f,0.9,167,93

When Zara Larsson posted her ignorant story saying that people should ""stand with palestine"" when jews were massacred, which had literally nothing to do with the cause btw, so many people were ""praising"" her for not being afraid to support Palestine. In what world is it controversial to support Palestine ? There are alot of Palestinian supporters on this sub, the most they could get are downvotes that's it. Btw you can support palestine but i have a problem when you spread every lie in the book to deshumanize Israelis and jews. It is baffling that there are people acting like the media is with israel. When the hospital was bombed, every major news outlet was quick to accuse Israel with no evidence. When Israelis die, they hardly ever mention it was Palestinian terrorist who was behind it. It is way more controversial and risky to support Israel. I lost half of my followers for posting one story about the massacre. An hostage family appeared on Time Magazine and lord the comments there are terrible. You can mention Israel in a span of 0,1 seconds on a tiktok or reel and you will see a swarm of bots spamming hate comments towards jews. And there is one thing that annoys, people being blatantly antisemitic and thinking they can get away with it by replacing jews with ""zionists"". Alot of people are misusing the word which is just a nationalist term that is no longer irrelevant since israel now exists ever since 1948. Whenever I explain the word to a non-jewish person they are telling me that I know nothimg about the word. I am sorry but you are not jewish and you can't change the meaning of a word you can't reclaim. I am not jewish myself and you will never see me defining antisemitism and words towards a minority. Tokenism is just terrible. Just because there are like 5 jews supporting palestine and being ""anti-zionists"" doesn't mean they stand up for the whole community.

Anyways, I wanted to tell u some stuff


u guys should really be grateful for the nation u bulit. democratic, good economy, powerful and developed to even defeat ur big hostile neighbors. Meanwhile I live in a way bigger country, lots of resources etc which is a complete shithole due to some dumbasses ruling it since the bloody 1979. IR made me hate religion and especially Islam, I never was a believer to begin with but now I'm proudly Islamophobic. My country has never seen a good day since the day it went under shria law and this arab religion. I fucking hate it. Our economy is so so bad due to sanctions near hyperinflation basically. Idk what to do, u guys whenever somewhere around the world can move to Israel if u feel unsafe or anything meanwhile my only home is occupied and ruined by these guys and it's just getting worse everyday... if I say I dislike Islam and aren't muslim they'll hang me. If I say I'm not against Israel/America they'll hang me and call me ""spy"". I'm also a woman which makes me a second class citizen by birth automatically, now add being an apostate to Islam too :) thanks to IR millions of Iranians are now nominal Muslims on their ID cards and have to pretend so they won't lose their heads.


Our school books are completely written by IR and they're full of propaganda on everything, holocaust for example isn't taught at all and the mention of ww2 is very brief if at all and they call the shah an Evil zionist regime who was destroying Islam in Iran and giving the country freely to American hands😂 Israel doesn't exist on our maps either, it's simply ""occupied Palestine"". The pics u see on social media on ""death to Israel/America"" are all a few ppl who are attached to the government, are given money and privilege and literally everything to come and shout those on the streets, The average normal Iranian calls them fools and betrayers to Iran for supporting the propaganda of such zealots...

It's all too stupid, why should we be enemies? Cyrus saved Jews from slavery and is considered a messiah in the book meanwhile IR wants us to morn for some Palestinians who don't even like Iranians. We should be allies as the only non arab nations of the middle east not enemies. Israel/Palestine isn't even an Iranian concern since we're neither Jew nor Arab and not even Muslim anymore lol then why the hell should billions of my money be spent on hezbollah and terrorism when my own ppl are hungry here and suffering from sanctions?!

Iran will perish till the day these guys are in power and the whole Middle East will see no peace either. I truly wish they can fuck off asap and let us have some freedom and relief. Hoping our relationship will someday be restored and we can be good alies with each other cuz we can be really beneficial for each other. I'm really hopeless for my nation atm as everything's too dark but I know the bad days haven't been eternal and we're a country with thousands of years of history and this isn't the first time we're dealing with enemies.

Sorry if it got too long hehe but I just wanted you to understand what's the reality here if u already didn't and just have a nice talk with u cuz I've never seen any Israeli or Jew in my whole life and would like to hear about ur opinions about my country, (the people and everything else not IR actions). I'd also like it if there's any iranian Jew here who will see my text.

There's a rumor my small hometown was actually Jewish before being converted forcefully after the Muslim invasion onwards and their explanation is the tomb of 2 rabbis being there but idk really, doesn't sound logical to myself as no one knows anything about it.

299,17t4dpn,2023-11-11,Israel,Nakba,"Here is my take as an Indian.

The nakba happened in 1948 where Jews in the Muslim world were expelled and Arabs in Israel after the war were expelled. Yes it was a bad thing thag happened. The Jewish refugees are now fully integrated into Israeli society whereas Palestinians from 1948 and their descendants are still living in refugee camps, no integration. Why are Palestinian people kept as perpetual refugees and not allowed to integrate into their new countries? Why can't they get citizenship? Is it because of some weird fantasy that the entire Israel would turn into Palestine and all Jews be driven out?

A nakba of sorts happened to my people too. One of my best friends is a Hindu whose family was expelled from Pakistan in 1947 since they weren't Muslim, 2 of my best friends are Sikh whose grandparents had to flee Pakistan for the same reason. My Bangladeshi Hindu friend had to flee while Pakistan was genociding Hindu Bangladeshis in 1971 (look it up its the biggest genocide since the holocaust, 3 million people mostly hindus were killed in less than a year, women taken as sex slaves etc). Their families suffered intensely and to this day my people who still live in Pakistan witness horrible lives.

This shit happened to us also. I don't see either of those 4 constantly whining about what Pakistan did even though no Hindu or Sikh wanted partition where btw 2 million people died. They have been fully integrated into Indian society and they harbour no hate to ordinary Muslims, unlike the intense hate people across the Arab world have for all Jews and Israelis. They think Israel has no right to exist.

The fact that an average Arab from places as far away from Palestine like Morocco or Iraq viscerally hates Israelis is equivalent to me saying I want all Sinhala people dead and Sri Lanka to stop existing because I am Tamil from India and Tamils were killed en masse in wars due to both the SL government and LTTE. I don't, many of my good friends are Sinhala and Sri Lankan Tamil both, I love Sri Lanka it's culture and people. That civil war ended as recently as 2009 as well, my SL Tamil friends who lived through the horrors of the war and have actually witnessed friends and family being killed have no hatred against Sinhala people, they are friends and even the Sinhala who witnessed LTTE terrorism get along with their Tamil friends.

I'm sorry but I don't buy this bullshit. I an genuinely convinced the Arab world and by extent the Muslim world is very radicalised, and it's not just because of their suffering since I gave all the examples of communities that suffered that still hope for peace and love rather than destruction.",Electronic_Drawing80,t2_jntaj2s0,0.86,99,36

315,140cq5m,2023-06-04,Israel,Is my professor biased?,"Hi! Writing here to get some insight. This semester, I took a subject called ""West Asia,"" and most of the focus was on the Israel-Palestine conflict. Our professor, is primarily a journalist (has a degree in traffic engineering, but at least has spent a long time in the Middle East.) The issue I have is that the professor consistently presents Israel as being in the wrong and portrays Palis as the ones in the right. I feel like he's not presenting the reality objectively, as he tends to focus more on the Palis perspective. When I learn from someone who is considered an expert, I expect unbiased information and a balanced view of the situation. But in his lessons, I could sense his sympathy for the Pali and Arab cause and his dislike for the state of Israel. He often stated only one side of reality or speculations. He downplayed instances of violence against Jews and subtly suggested that it was somehow their fault when violence occurred. 
Examples of weird things he says: 1) he claimed that Jews did not experience anti-Semitism in Arab countries ruled by Islam before the creation of the state of Israel. 2) He spoke only of the immigration of Russian and Eastern European citizens to Palestine, ignoring the Mizrahi or Sephardic Jews (so it looked like classical narrative of „European colonizers“). 3) he said Jews doesn’t equal Zionists, saying they had to be convinced they were a nation (to create Israel) despite not having much in common except religion (what about ethnicity and origin?!). He recommended a book called ""An Imaginary Nation“. 4) when speaking about the “only Jewish claim” to land Israel - from Bible, he questioned its authenticity, suggesting it might have been written up to 1000 years after the events it describes. 5) Jewish archaeologists deliberately dug under Arab houses (poor palis) to find Jewish artifacts and used them to claim the land as their „promised land“ 6) when discussing Palestinians collaborating with Nazis, he quickly added that Jewish extremists also wanted to collaborate with Hitler. 7) he said that fe. Iraqi jews didn’t want to go Israel and so its possible that Israel's secret services orchestrated attacks on Jewish institutions in diaspora countries, such as Iraq, to coerce Jews into making aliyah 8) says that caricature of Jews are censored in the west, so they don’t get their feelings hurt, but caricatures of muslims are not censored and so of course muslims see this „unjust“ approach (Charlie Hebdo etc.) 9) when speaking about ""pallywood"" he says that israel happilly release the correct footage to the world to say ""look how palis are manipulating the world"". He adds ""my personal journalistic point of view is: I don’t know why are the Palis doing this, cause they have been shot dead so many times by Israelis in reality, why are they inventing some more and actually harming themselves? But that's their fight."" 10) stuff like: israel is blocking gaza and poor people there have to light with oil lamp etc. 11) our country is too much pro-israel and fe.: our politicians who display Israeli flag as a solidarity symbol here is distasteful. 
Oh and unrelated example of his strange views: he compares Iran morality police to police here in EU. Like: „you also cant go out here in EU in just a bra or naked!“ WTF. 
Anyway…He rarely mentions anything bad about Palis (the daily violence, terrorists hiding behind their own civilians, kids indoctrination, no elections etc. if so, he excuse it by Israels fault).
I know Israel isn’t perfect (who is?!) but damn, I think ppl who don’t know much about Israel just got served with very strange biased lectures. Im thinking about talking about it to school superiors. Thanks.",Stunning-Web-4136,t2_kq9izzau,0.85,58,80

Why should we ever support such oppressive Islamic states? Why should we not criticize the double standards of Muslims where they are quick to demand equal rights to preach Islam and convert people to Islam in non-Muslim countries, but are not ready to give us the same human rights?**

As I dont have stakes in it, my perspective is for both sides, discussed it with many Israeli academics as well alongside some Arab friends.","I have been to Israel and very fascinated with the place, and have read up quite a lot on the history of the nation to present day. My perspective on peace process is this:

1) One state solution will just be unsustainable to maintain as the intifada can return anytime in the absence of the barrier, assuming both the parties live together without segregation. On top of that, Israel's Jewish character will be very soon threatened if Arabs in West Bank/Gaza get voting rights to decide the fate of the single nation. One chance to make the decision and you know what will happen. Not at all realistically possible, ignoring the fact that coexistence given the historic wounds and grudges would be just too difficult.

2) Two state solution would suffer from a lack contiguous landmass problem for Palestine as Gaza would be cutoff from West Bank. I believe there was some discussion to link WB with Gaza via some route in some peace initiative (Camp David?) but its difficult. Pakistan was divided into West and East prior to 1971 with India in the middle. Couldn't sustain for long. And politically the FATAH/Hamas would refuse to reconcile anyway. But its still a better way as Palestinians get their nation this way. Another roadblock would be settlements. How do you resettle so many of them? Increasingly difficult. Israel did pull out of Gaza but just look the settler numbers today, its huge! Slightly better than one state solution, but still difficult to achieve. Ultimately my gut instinct says peace will be achieved through some two state variant.

3) Right of return just cant hold anymore. I understand the Palestinian plight but didn't so many Indians lose their home in Pakistan for no reason when our partition happened? They must be resettled properly in the place where they stay, with external funding as its very unlikely that host nation would have the funds to do it (e.g. Lebanon). Indians were driven away from Pakistan, when many didn't want to leave. Its something we may made peace with and they settled down here, given that its a colonial decision that can't be undone, as unfortunate as it is.

4) If Iranian regime falls (difficult but possible), Hezbollah and Hamas weaken, Qatar is not as rabid, and peace process talks get started. This is the only way, though Hezbollah especially won't give up so easily, it has more than 100000 rockets? 

5) I sincerely feel the rabid hate for Israelis, especially in Egypt and Gaza, is shocking and more introspection is needed. Is it all Israel's fault that Gaza is what it is today? Partially, maybe, but who elected Hamas when Israel pulled out? You make your destiny, as philosophical and preachy as it sounds, but Israel will stay here and coexistence, not on 1948 basis with right of return but that which reflects current trend is the way going ahead. Need one leader from FATAH/Hamas who can stand for this. Unpopular opinion over there, he might get lynched, but sooner someone smells the coffee, earlier Palestinians will get a better future.

Some of the best war films around (*Waltz with Bashir*, *Kippur* and *Hill 24 Doesn’t Answer*) are Israeli. Personally I don’t understand delegitimising a movie because of its political message. But that’s what really confuses me about the online hate for *Waltz with Bashir* - I never got the feeling once that it was pro-Israel or pro-war. In fact it seems to be incredibly focused on the horrors of the Lebanon War, which leads me to question the potential propaganda of this loaded term.

I understand that it’s possible that Israeli filmmakers first used it but whenever I hear it used now it seems that it’s being used by anti-Israel opinions.

328,13mmm5x,2023-05-20,Israel,How different would history be if Israel had taken over the whole Mandate territory during the Independence War?,"I need your help with a speculative history question. I’ve been doing some research on the 1948 Arab-Israeli War and I came across two different opinions on what would have happened if Israel had conquered (had they had the military capabilities to do so) all of the former British Mandate of Palestine. 

Edit: for clarity, I mean only the areas of the mandate without Transjordan 

Option 1) Some people think that it was a missed opportunity and that Israel should have gone for it. They argue that if Ben Gurion had given the order, Israel would have taken over the whole land from the sea to the river and made it their official borders. They claim that the world would have accepted this as a fact on the ground, just like they did with the Green Line after the war.

Option 2) Others think that it would have been a huge mistake and that Israel dodged a bullet. They argue that if Israel had occupied all of the territory, the international community would have pressured them to withdraw all the way back to the 1947 UN Partition Plan lines. They claim that the only reason the world recognized the Green Line as Israel’s borders was because Israel didn’t overreach and showed some restraint.

So what do you guys think? What would have happened if Israel had captured all of the mandate territory in 1948 war? Do you agree with option 1, 2 or have some other theory?",Scipio2023,t2_aqwsarqe,0.87,35,25

Then he continued by speaking about harmless rocks thrown by Arabs, their rockets that do not kill, a lie those rockets do kill and take the IDF out and those rockets will kill better and then how Israel was at fault for occupying Palestine. This led them to draw parallels between the deaths caused by the actions of Israeli soldiers attempting to quell terrorism and those carried out by terrorists themselves. To make matters worse, after one person in the audience stated some of this and Rami answered some more nonsense, several Jewish Australians applauded these statements, leaving me enraged.

Anyway, watching the Left actively support Palestine and Hamas; a group that is very obviously against all of their values, has been disturbing and slightly amusing. Hamas, who beheaded babies, butchered families, and shoots their own civilians trying to leave an active warzone, constantly posts propaganda through their ""health"" ministry, and through social media, and both the MSM and leftists immediately trust whatever they say without question. This is how the hospital hoax was started, this is how the false narrative of ""Israel occupying Palestine"" gave rise. It is completely biased in one direction and the Left doesn't even consider that maybe the people who would kill them for being gay, or behead them for being an infidel, might be wrong. 
And this brings me to my next point.

The people who are out on the street saying ""free Palestine"" are not only anti-Israel, but also anti-American. Many are Islamic, but many are Leftists. Joining in anti-American chants; basically, they are cheering for their own demise and the demise of their own nation. These people march side by side with Jihadists. The Left is fighting with Jihadists. Let that sink in. The true implications of that are enormous. In the eyes of the Jihadists, Israel and America are joined at the hip. What they have done to Israel, they want to do to America. So not only do they not want Israel to exist, it seems that they don't their own nation to exist, or even themselves! And this is the point I'm getting at:

What do you do when a portion of your own people side with the terrorists that want to destroy you and your ally?
Why is the Left siding with the people who want to destroy all of us?

I would question if those people are even American at that point. 
This is what we are dealing with.
These are the enemies the West is facing:

We are facing the enemy of deception. The enemy of jihad. The enemy of hysteria. The enemy of division. The enemy of self-destruction. The enemy of hatred. The enemy of antisemitism.

I see this as a threat to the existence of the West, and the decay of morality and critical thinking. In this way, I am extremely disturbed and scared for this planet. But I want to end off by encouraging you guys. I don't know what surveys, or polls are true; as the truth died the second this war started, but I do know that there are millions of American that support you Israel, and that you ARE NOT ALONE. Do not be afraid, but be of good courage. I have no doubt that you will win!

335,17udkfh,2023-11-13,Israel,"Her caption: “Much love to the Palestinians, and everyone speaking up about it, never stop, keep boycotting, keep screaming”","Been following this creator on TT for a while. She normally posts funny commentary stuff but yesterday I got this vitriolic ignorant bile on my feed. Nauseated doesn’t even begin to describe my feelings. How are you guys dealing with content creators going full mask-off anti-Jew? Here are some of my thoughts on what she said.

She says she “only learned about this in the past month, since Oct 7th.” Sounds about right.

She goes on to say that she’s “glad f*cking Israelis cry that much” and that Israelis are doing “a smear campaign on Palestinians.” The massacre was a smear campaign?? The rapes and beheadings? You’re glad about that?? Interesting. 

She calls Israel “a country that’s only been around for 75 years” while not even mentioning our indigenous ties to the land or talking about why there are so many Jews in the diaspora. 

She says that she sees “Israeli flags everywhere” and when people put up Palestinian flags, they get “attacked… doxxed… they lose their jobs…. managements…. agencies…. friends.” Where the fuck does she live, because if anything, it’s completely the other way around. Shuls and Jewish homes getting vandalized, Jews killed and attacked in France and other countries, hostage posters torn down, antisemitic hate crimes on rapid rise globally. Who is she actually talking about? 

She says that “it is shameful to call this a war when there is no military on the other side.” Palestine is backed by Hamas, which is a terrorist organization. If you were there they would kill you, full stop. She seems (purposefully) unaware that Israel has offered Hamas a ceasefire multiple times and been rejected. She seems (purposefully) unaware that Israelis are happy to let peaceful Palestinians coexist with them in Israel, while Hamas calls for an eradication of all Jews. That all the surrounding Middle Eastern counties have expelled their Jews over the last hundreds of years. 

She says that Israel supporters “make [Hamas] seem like a terrorist organization” and that she’s “never heard the word ‘terrorist’ used against any nation, color, or religion, only Muslims.” This is blatantly false. No one is making Hamas “seem” like a terrorist organization, they ARE a terrorist organization by definition. No one with their head on straight is calling all Muslims terrorists right now, and implying that that’s what Zionists believe is deliberately untrue and inflammatory. I have heard the term terrorist be used against many different types of people (ex: “Christian terrorist” or “homegrown terrorist” for school shooters). 

Of course the “dead babies” line makes an appearance. Some casual “they have so much influence over everyone” rhetoric too for that perfect “Jews control the media” narrative. One casual mention of antisemitism being on the rise at the very end, but immediately followed by “those Zionists are systematically protected by our laws so who’s really oppressed??” Just call us k*kes and stoke your oven already. It would at least be more honest.

This is the type of vitriol and misinformed bullshit I’ve been seeing and hearing all over the place since Oct 7th. Young people, especially young leftists who knew nothing of the conflict prior to a month ago, falling hook-line-and-sinker for Hamas propaganda. She claims that Jews being afraid to go outside is a lie perpetuated by Israel? Tell that to our sister in France. 

I don’t even know what else to say, guys. This made me so sick. Everyone lauding her in the comments. I’m afraid to say anything on TT because I’ve already gotten death threats on social media, so I wanted to put my thoughts here. 

Please don’t harass anyone over this video; my point is to have a discussion over this type of narrative and how you guys are coping with friends, creators, or peers who have been perpetuating it. Thank you.",spaceboundziggy,t2_qoruyup,0.78,28,56

341,zjkibm,2022-12-12,Israel,Update and ?’s Re: Christian Pilgrimage,"Hi all, I asked a couple months ago about currency for this “pilgrimage” I was taking with my diocese (Catholic) in Israel. The organizer had suggested all sorts of nonsense and luckily I followed my instincts from my former experience as a kibbutz ulpanist/volunteer and your advice-thanks again for your help with that. It turned out we did spend a lot of time in Palestine and they definitely wanted dollars…never again, lol.

To my question: As someone who supports Israel and the Jewish people in all respects I found this Pilgrimage very disturbing. 

After having spent a decent amount of time in Israel prior (given, on a kibbutz and mostly around the Jezreel valley) I was shocked at the behavior of the guide (an Arab Christian from Jerusalem), the content of the tour: some outrageous claims were made, such as Isaiah 53 is “banned” in synagogues 🙄…I told everyone I could that was bullshit. Trash taking about the Talmud, treating Jerusalem and the country at large like our own personal Disney World (aka existing in a vacuum for our viewing pleasure)…not taught anything about Jewish history (except in support of Jesus) or the history of Israel as a modern Jewish state (I was the one having to do this as the guide didn’t and seemed actually hostile to Judaism and Israel, despite living his whole life in Jerusalem). How do you all deal with this?!
I’m from an Ivy League college town in the US and I’m annoyed just by the students coming back after summer, how do you feel about all these pilgrims invading your cities with huge tour buses, little respect, etc, etc? Does the tourism industry make it worth it?
If I were you I wouldn’t want us at all…this trip gave me a lot of doubts about Christianity and the validity of a religion that-at least on the pilgrimage, and according to our guide’s “teaching”- is dependent on “debunking” your religion. 

I’d like to give some constructive feedback to my diocese, pilgrimage planners, etc on the experience and they have already read tomes of my outrage and complaints, so I’m curious of your thoughts. 

I know it’s not your responsibility to educate Christians but I appreciate any feedback. I hated being part of anything that disrespects Israel or Judaism and I want to help make changes for Catholic pilgrimages there in the future.",brishen_is_on,t2_31f0e1e,0.85,19,15

I'm trying to understand the origins of the issue and the starting point i chose was the 1880, the beginnings of the zionist movement. I'm doing a lot of research on how it all started and why and the events that led up to the Aliyas from different parts of the world.

According to the information i was able to find there's a lot of contradiction on how the first settlers moved to Palestine and settled there. Most Israeli documentation i could find indicated that the majority of the land was purchased legally, however also acknoledging that at some point there were conflicts and forced displacements occured.

The other side of the conflict claims that the majority of the land was taken by force, that they welcomed the settlers (with some minor conflicts between farmers and owners at first). However, they claim that the majority of the land was taken by force.

I would like to understand, geniunley in good faith. As a hypothetical, if there is significant evidence to point that the land was taken mostly by force, would that sway you to understand the palestinian side more? I'm also looking to ask the opposite side the same, if the land was taken mostly legally would they be swayed to change their mind as well.. but seeing as im on this sub-reddit...

After Putin started the invasion on Ukraine, I prepared my jewish heritage documents and moved to Israel.

In soviet time in our family nor grand grandfather, nor grandfather never talked about realtives in Israel. For safety reasons I guess. I did some research, found her on myheritige website, found that she had a son and a grandson (he passed away in 2011).

It’s not a matter of which country you support (Palestine v. Israel) it’s a matter of terrorism and anti-semitism. 
Social media and college activists are misinformed. The Israeli government gave Palestine citizens chances to leave, they TOLD them they were bombing in defense of themselves.
When they didn’t listen, they gave them 4 hours to get out. (Source: “Israel warns Gaza it will attack by land, air and sea as its evacuation deadline passes” https://www.euronews.com/2023/10/14/palestinians-flee-northern-gaza-after-israel-orders-mass-evacuation-with-ground-attack-loo )
Yes, it’s horrible that there are innocent people in Gaza dying for what Hamas supports. 
In war, you have to defend yourself. It’s a matter of anti-semitism. Previously, Jews were not able to defend themselves. They need to now. It’s unreasonable to expect a country that had its citizens taken and killed for fun and the purpose of just not liking how they look, the majority’s religion status, etc. and that BROADCASTED PROUDLY, putting your country to shame not to retaliate in some way, and they did so reasonably, warning the citizens that would be affected.

I am wondering, though I understand that it is a situation with much tension, what the possible reason could be behind that action?  

I read that the ongoing military measures is a response meant to de-escalate as the mosque was barricaded.

The Times of Israel has helped me before with this, but this time all I can find is one sentence without stating any reason behind:

372,17ttw1x,2023-11-12,Israel,Solution to Conflict,"Repost because this didnt generate as much of the discussion I hoped for in other subs

Let me start by saying these two things:

1. People have the right to live where they are born and thrive. Regardless of your version of Levantine history, anyone saying Israelis are colonists and need to ""go back"" when they have nowhere to go back to and are being subjected to hate crimes throughout the world, or who seriously thinks mass, violent expulsion of Palestinians into Jordan or Egypt is ok, is a bad human being.

2: There is no way Israel and Palestine can negotiate a solution while Jerusalem and the Right of Return remain issues. The former is so muddled in extreme sentiment of religious destiny that trying to co-manage it would be impossible, and the latter is a dogwhistle for destroying Israel because the vast majority of Palestinian refugees today have never been to Israel and considering what happened when a border got breached on Oct 7th, demanding Israel gave 5 million people many of whom cheer the death of all Israelis, id a ludicrous demand for ""peace.""

Anyway on to the only solution to this quagmire I can think of:

1. The UN, Arab League, EU, US, and any other interested parties who have been giving billions in aid to Gaza form a genuine organization devoted to building and sustaining a working infrastructure for the people of Gaza. Aid money gets directly used by said organization to allow for food production, building, water and electricity access, etc. Essentially an international humanitarian takeover of Gaza. Hamas cannot keep ruling it without Israel being in an eternal conflict with them. Israel cannot reasonably keep sustaining its populace with energy/food/water while it's used to beef up Hamas, and it isnt fair to Palestinian civilians to be food or power insecure at the whim of Israel.

2: Israel builds a massive border wall, electrified, with automatic turrets. Anyone who steps within a certain number of feet gets shot. At the same time, Gaza is allowed to develop airports, and Israel stops the sea blockade. The Israeli Navy continues to kill anyone who tries to cross a maritime border into Israel. Either this, or some kind of monitored demilitarized zone like with the North-South Korea border. Any single rocket or other attack gets responded to with a rocket where it was launched.

3: Israel abandons all remote settlements in the West Bank. Many of the people there are anti-Arab extremists, who believe the land is Jewish only. The only true ""colonists"" in this conflict are them, because they could go to Israel proper, they have a potential home, and the expansion of settlements amounts to theft of Palestinian land. The settlers are given money and means of transportation. If they choose to stay, they will not be supported by the IDF, and will die in the inevitable skirmishes with Palestinians that follow.

4: Given Israel has no negotiating partner in Hamas OR the PA, whose leader is a Holocaust denier who funds the families of anyone who kills Israelis, and who rejected all peace offers that dont involve the wholesale destruction of Israel through the ""Right of Return"" dogwhistle, Israel acts unilaterally. Large settlements at the West Bank border without a Palestinian presence are annexed, for everything past that, a massive, electrified wall, with turrets, or a demilitarized zone, same as with Gaza.

5: Israel proclaims a unified Jerusalem as its capital. Palestinians in East Jerusalem are offered Israeli citizenship with full equal rights. Their immediate family members in the West Bank are either also offered citizenship, or at least some kind of visiting permit situation. Anyone who refuses Israeli citizenship is deported, with their possessions and net worth carefully provided to them when they move into the West Bank. I know this seems harsh, but every time there was Arab rule of Jerusalem, Jewish holy sites and people were utterly disrespected, under Israeli rule yes there have been raids in Al Aqsa when people are throwing stones at Jews, but ultimately Israel has shown the Waqf far more respect than Muslims have shown Jews in Jerusalem over history. Al Aqsa is Judaism's holiest site but only third in Islam. Israel must guarantee absolute religious freedom and protection for Muslims in Jerusalem.

6: Israel invests money in integrating the Israeli Arab population. Stamp down on crime, end housing discrimination, make it clear to Israelis Arabs that this is their home and they should be treated with dignity.

I understand this solution sounds brutal and stupid, but FFS, it's better than the status quo, and it's better than what the Israeli right and most Palestinians want from a moral standpoint. A free Palestine whose destiny is in its hands, Israel no longer occupying another people and securing its borders. I seriously have yet to see anything better proposed by anyone.

381,109d38o,2023-01-11,Israel,My suggestion for the Israeli Center-Left for the decades ahead,"**My Background**:

I'm a Jew who lives in North America.  I'm mostly right wing politically.  However, the current government forming in Israel is too extreme for me.  Some of their policies I disagree with and some of their public statements I find alarming and outrageous.

**My Key Understandings:**

1. When it comes to politics, Israel is basically split 50/50 between 2 groups:

Group A: Traditional Right + Ultra orthodox + Religious Zionists/Settlers

Group B: Everyone else (Center + Left + Arab + Secular Right)

2. There are 2 demographics growing very rapidly due to much higher birth rates in Israel: Ultra Orthodox and Religious Zionists/Settlers.  Therefore, if there is no change to the groups listed above, then in the long run Group A will gradually win Israeli elections by larger and larger margins, as a result of higher birth rates of Ultra Orthodox and Religious Zionists/Settlers.

3. I realize that the Left's current platforms oppose the agenda of the Ultra Orthodox and also oppose the agenda of the Religious Zionists/Settlers.

**My Claim:**

If the center-left:

1. Gives the Ultra Orthodox more than the right gives the Ultra Orthodox, then the center-left can form a government with the Ultra Orthodox and successfully implement center-left policies on Settlements, Two State Solution, and Palestine over the long run
2. Gives the Religious Zionists/Settlers more than the Right gives the Religious Zionist/Settlers, then the center-left can form a government with the Religious Zionists/Settlers and successfully implement center-left policies on IDF Draft, Religion and State, and Chief Rabbinate Control of Civil Life over the long run

Are either of these good options for the center-left?  No.  Considering the values of the center-left, both are bad options.

But if the center-left continues to pick neither of these two options, then the center-left is not going to be able to successfully implement over the long term its policies on either the Ultra Orthodox category of issues or the Religious Zionists/Settlers category of issues.  Why?  Because demographically the Ultra Orthodox and Religious Zionists/Settlers are growing rapidly due to higher birth rates and opposing both groups means that the center-left will not be able to form a government and successfully implement its policies without at least one of those two groups.

**Questions:**

Obviously I'm interested in anyone's thoughts, as long as they are polite and respectful.

I'll note that I have 2 main questions:

1. Am I wrong about what is realistic?  Is it realistic for the center-left to form governments in the long run (decades into the future) and implement at least some of its agenda on these issues without both the Religious Zionists/Settlers and also without the Ultra Orthodox?  If so, how?  For example, do you think that the center-left will be able to win a big chunk of Likud voters after Bibi dies/retires?
2. If I'm right that it's not realistic for the center-left to be able to form governments without at least one of those two groups in the long run to durably implement center-left agenda on at least one of those categories of issues, then am I wrong about what the center-left should do about this?  Am I wrong to think that the center-left should give more to one of those two groups than the Traditional Right does in order to change the groupings?  If so, why am I wrong?

Also,in Jewish areas the Gov won\`t come in and destroy your house just for a permit issue. Is this true? And if so, how do you guys feel about it?",Ill-Week4442,t2_7k2ours0,0.36,0,6

Listen, I am neither pro Israel nor pro Palestine, but I really hate the government of Netanyahu. I think he’s a horrible human being who cares only for himself, and not others. 

It breaks my heart that these restrictions taken by Benjamin Netanyahu are ripping Israel apart, even though it was founded on the principles that EVERY Jew, regardless of differences of devoutness or beliefs, could live in harmony together. This shouldn’t be happening. 

I would have to say, not ALL Orthodox Jews support Netanyahu or his actions. I bet a fair majority of them I would say disagree with Netanyahu, and his government does NOT represent all Orthodox Jews. 

Gaetz even warned Netanyahu that he was setting the nation on a collision course for civil war. And apparently, not even a lot of right wing ideologues agree with Netanyahu’s plan for the judicial system. 

It’s a mess. I just hope to god civil war won’t happen.

Anyways , in December of 2022 I flew to Tel Aviv where I was interrogated by the immigration officer who questioned me thoroughly. He checked my phone and found a picture that was against the Israeli government and a telegram channel called “ Gaza now” that I had subscribed last year  to follow news on the latest updates on any escalations in the region. I don’t know if this was enough to deny me entry but I was anyhow and deported. I was handed a document that stated I was denied entry based on “ public security considerations”

I am a Muslim but I am neither an Arab nor do I have an affiliation towards any group and I hold an opinion that’s not biased towards either of the two countries.

408,17emxho,2023-10-23,Palestine,I used to be pro-Palestinian,"I used to be pro-Palestinian. I thought Israel was wrong for carpet bombing Gaza and using siege warfare on civilians.  

But then I ran into a very wise Israel apologist who changed my way of looking at things forever. 

 I was walking down the street and I saw him leaning against a lamp post, smoking a pipe as wise men do.  “Your shirt says Free Palestine,” he said from behind a plume of smoke.  

“Yep!” I replied.  

“So I guess that means you love Hamas then?” spake he. 

 I stopped in my tracks. I’d never thought of it that way before.  Could it be? Could my opposition to murdering civilians really be indicative of a deep affection for a Gazan militant group? Maybe I really did love Hamas and think everything it did on October 7 was great and wonderful?  

“Is this really how I want to live my life?” I thought to myself.  

“I — I — I…” I said out loud.  

“Or perhaps,” he said with a raised eyebrow, “you just HATE JEWS??” 

 I fell to my knees.  

Oh my God. He really had a point. What possible reason could anyone have for opposing military explosives being dropped on buildings full of children besides a seething lifelong hatred of adherents to the religion of Judaism? How could anyone possibly oppose siege warfare tactics which cut off civilians from food and water and electricity and fuel and medical supplies unless they harbored a dangerous hostility toward members of a small Abrahamic faith?  

“Who… who are you?” I asked.  

“That’s of no consequence,” he said, casually blowing a smoke ring through another larger smoke ring.  

“But… but the children,” I stammered as my entire worldview crumbled before my eyes. “The civilians! They’re dying! Isn’t it bad that they’re dying?”  

And then he went for the coup de grâce. 

&#x200B;

 “Have you considered,” he said before a pregnant pause, “… that all of those deaths are the fault of Hamas?”  

I fell flat on my back. The world was spinning. A trickle of blood ran down into my hair from my ear.  

I felt all the anti-colonialism leaving my body. I suddenly could no longer remember why I thought it was bad to rain down military explosives on a densely populated concentration camp. 

 Everything went black.  

When I finally came to, the mysterious stranger was gone. But his wisdom and profound insights into Israel and Gaza will always live on in my heart.

I wanna offer my deepest apologies to palestinians here and all around the world. A few years ago, I was rabidly pro-israel. I used to passionately defend Israel and say the most awful things about palestinians. 

But, I realized afterwards that Israel isn't the democracy I imagined it to be. So I just became indifferent and neutral. I thought that both sides sucked equally. I still talked awful things about Palestine. 

But now, with this horror happening in Gaza, I have seen the naked ugly face of Israeli apartheid and brutality. It's no different than apartheid South Africa and I have seen how Palestinians are second-class citizens in their own ancestral lands, ravaged by colonizers.

Looking back at it, I'm incredibly ashamed of myself for having ever been pro-Israel. I'm overcome with regret. I don't know how I ever could support Israel, don't know what I was thinking. What Israel is doing against civilians in Gaza is just pure evil.

I don't blame any of you if you won't forgive me. I myself have a hard time forgiving myself. For what it's worth, I support Palestine all the way now.

I've observed firsthand as more and more of your rights were stripped from you. I've watched as the world stayed silent, playing ""The Three Monkeys."" with Israel. 

Now, in the current days, Hamas has launched a raid on the Israeli occupiers. Israel's response is what everyone here, I think, expected. But what I could have never imagined was the response of the European nations and the West. The absolute corruption and hypocrisy is something that puts everything else to shame. 

I'm not just talking about the governments; I'm talking about the nations as a whole. 

Calling for genocide, collective punishment, and celebrating the deaths of innocent civilians. Even just showing the Palestinian flag is now considered support for Hamas.

I am ashamed to see my own government partake in such hypocrisy.

For the first time, more such strong voices in favor of Palestine are being heard in Europe in spite of the relentless one sided media coverage✊","Listen and Read. Very powerful and moving. 

Transcript, translated to English:

All the hostages, all the dead from Israel and Europe, have received their names. Their family members and friends have been heard here on TV, in the newspaper. Their lives, dreams and ideals are known to us forever. And I think that's fair.

But I have a question. Do Palestinian lives have the same value for us?

Do we also know the names of their dead babies, their humiliated grandparents and murdered children?

Do we know their individual dreams, friends and school reports? Palestinian lives are mentioned in numbers. 48 dead, 1,200 wounded. No names, just numbers.

And this indicates how we divide ourselves. Because Palestinians are also burned alive. 

Palestinian villages also know pogroms, performed by Israelis. Palestinian children are tortured and imprisoned for years without help.

This has been happening generation after generation, for more than 75 years. Maybe that's why we've become immune.

For us, they're not people, they're collective suffering. Will it ever stop? But for me, it's family. And I don't think it will ever stop.

But I'm talking about the blind support for a system of individuality and ethnic cleansing.

After the Hamas attacks, Prime Minister Rutte said we haven't often seen this conflict focus on ordinary people.

Apparently, he doesn't see Palestinians as ordinary people. But they exist. We exist. The tiny Gaza is home to 2.2 million people. Almost half of them are still children.

Of all the children in Gaza, 80% are diagnosed with depression. Do we ever wonder what they're dreaming of?

Israel tells 2 million desperate citizens that they all have to go south in one day, for their own safety.

And then Israel bombards these refugees in the south.

Israel tells hospitals to vacate because the north will be swept away.

But how? How can sick and wounded, clad in medical equipment, leave hospitals?

The elderly, the sick, the handicapped, the weakest. So they stay behind and face their fate.

Last night, we witnessed such a fate. An overcrowded hospital in the city of Gaza.

I looked at the footage and saw a man walking around with a plastic bag. He held it above his head, as if it was a precious bread.

It wasn't bread. The bag contained the remains of his children's flesh and bones.

I sat down and cried like an animal. There's something wrong with humanity. Something wrong with us and with everyone who looks at us and doesn't intervene.

I have one wish, because dreams don't exist in this hell. That one of the hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees, dead and wounded will write down their names and interview their family members on national television, night after night.

This will be broadcast on countless TV channels. It would be absurd, but it would be honest.

Why would you believe the US government when they just vetoed a resolution that could only prevent suffering? A government who have said they unequivocally support Israel? A government who lied in support of Israel only days ago.

Furthermore, if Palestine had rockets this powerful, where are the demolished Israeli buildings? Odd how all the demolished buildings are in Palestine.

Israel destroyed a school in Gaza earlier the same day. They bombed ambulances after murdering innocents fleeing South on the road they had designated as safe passage. They threatened to bomb the al-Ahli Arab Hospital several times before they did. They have bombed hospitals in the past (source: https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2014/07/israelgaza-attacks-medical-facilities-and-civilians-add-war-crime-allegations/).

Erdogan attended the rally, too.

  
His speech:

In all the places our horizon extends, we share the sorrows of our brothers and sisters who turn their hearts and eyes towards us. We offer our help, cross borders when necessary, just as we are standing with Gaza today. A century ago, what Adana was to this nation, Gaza is today. Scratch beneath the words of Israeli leaders, and you'll find a treacherous map that encompasses the borders of our country. The greatest responsibility for the massacre in Gaza lies with the West. Just as no game lasts forever, the West's sinister and dirty tactics have been exposed. I say to the West: Do you want to provoke a Crescent-Cross struggle? Israel has been committing war crimes openly for 22 days. We will declare you as a war criminal to the world, Israel. We are preparing for this.

At the horizon of our geography, for the eternal waving of our flag, and for the recitation of our call to prayer until the end of days, I express my gratitude to all those who work, use their intellect and sweat.

You are such a great nation that you have demonstrated it in a unique way. We are such a great nation and state that our strength and struggle are not limited to our own borders alone.

Once upon a time, we too, as a nation, showed the world what it means to be a nation, and taught the concept of nationality. In short, wherever our horizon extends, we stand in solidarity with our brothers and sisters, turning our hearts and eyes towards us, sharing their troubles, extending a helping hand, and, just as today, standing up for Gaza.

From Crimea to Karabakh, from Bosnia to Kirkuk, from Palestine to Turkistan, from Afghanistan to Chechnya, we shed tears for many regions. Our lifetime was not in vain. Today, some perceive Gaza as a distant place, entirely unrelated to us, and even say this openly. Yet, a century ago, Gaza was what Adana was to this nation and this country. Just as Mardin is to Mosul, Gaziantep to Aleppo, Gaza was an inseparable part of the homeland we considered. How did we come this far? When you visit the Çanakkale Martyrs' Memorial, take a good look at the names and cities on the tombstones. You will see that just as there are people from Balıkesir and Şanlıurfa, Gazans and Skopje's residents lie side by side.

There is no doubt that Turkey is a great nation. Turkey is a country that stands above never-ending major threats.

I said that Hamas is not a terrorist organization, and this greatly disturbed Israel. We didn't expect anything different. Because we knew this, we expressed it clearly and openly.

I said that Hamas is not a terrorist organization, and this greatly upsets Israel. We didn't expect anything different. Because we knew this, we stated it clearly and openly. We say, ""La galibe illallah,"" meaning, ""There is no victor but Allah."" We believe in this. Only Allah is the Victor.  
Here, we are not just interpreting the massacre in Gaza, but also defending our own independence and future. Sultan Abdülhamid had significant dealings with these regions. In 1947, what was Gaza, what was Palestine, and what are they today? Israel, how did you come here, how did you enter? You are an occupier. You are an organization. The Turkish nation knows this. The West owes you, but Turkey does not owe you anything. That's why we speak so confidently. Erdogan speaks this way because Turkey does not owe you anything. Unfortunately, every country in the West owes you. They cannot speak. They come to visit you. They practically beg for forgiveness by visiting you. We don't have such a concern. We stand with the oppressed. We have always been a nation that stands with the oppressed in the face of tyranny. When the occupiers of Jerusalem are against us, the politics of those who go to the tomb of Sultan Saladin, the conqueror of this blessed city, to vent their thousand-year-old grievances have a stake. Against us are the unresolved accounts of those who have cut us into pieces politically, geographically, socially, and economically for the past two centuries. We will not allow those who fail to understand this simple truth out of negligence or try to cover it up with betrayal to distort the facts stolen by the infidels' sword.  


Those who shed crocodile tears for civilians killed in the Ukraine-Russia war are silently watching the deaths of thousands of innocent children today. You shed tears for those who died in Ukraine, but why is your voice silent for these innocent children who died in Gaza? I say to the West: Are you trying to incite another Crescent-Cross struggle? If you are making such an effort, know that this nation is not dead. This nation stands strong. And in the same way, with the same determination, what we are in Libya, what we are in Karabakh, be aware that we are the same in the Middle East.   


Especially in the last 10 years, despite all the challenges, we have achieved what we set out to do in the fight against terrorism. Inshallah, we will continue to move forward on the path we have charted with the motto ""We can come suddenly one night."" We are always ready to walk this path with our people. With the permission of Allah, this nation is ready to write new epics.

https://reddit.com/link/17ihgpl/video/esni55r20zwb1/player

The greatest responsibility for the massacre in Gaza lies with the West. Just as no game lasts forever, the West's sinister and dirty tactics have now been exposed. We are well aware of who is behind the worthless terrorists raised against us in the north of Iraq and Syria. Who stands behind the PKK, YPG, and FETÖ?

When it comes to talk, we know very well the reasons for which human rights advocacy institutions and individuals are trying to hinder our country.  


The Western world has mobilized, from politicians to the media, to legitimize the massacre of women, children, and innocent people in Gaza. Israel has been openly committing war crimes for 22 days. Israel, we will declare you as a war criminal to the world. We are preparing for this. We are working on this, and we will introduce Israel to the world as a war criminal.  


Marketplaces, schools, and every standing structure are the targets of this barbarism. Over 30,000 buildings and more than 200,000 residences have been completely devastated. There is almost no home left for any Gazan to seek shelter in. The infrastructure for electricity, water, and sewage has already been entirely destroyed. Due to the lack of permission for outside assistance, essential needs like electricity, food, healthcare, and sanitation materials couldn't be met. Despite this grim situation, the dignified and unwavering stance of the people of Gaza will be recorded in history as a resistance epic. Faith and determination are such qualities that, as our ancestors used to say, can even extract milk from a bull.   
The people of Gaza are ready to defend their homeland with their teeth. Are we ready as well? This nation has done it. They did it yesterday, they are doing it today, and with the permission of Allah, they will do it tomorrow. None of the Palestinians who once left their homes, thinking they would find peace when they returned, ever made it back. Now, they are saying the same thing for the people of Gaza. What are these immoral people saying? They are telling them to go. When asked where, they say to the desert, to cross into another country. They point to that door. Those who listen to these words and set out on the road because they are injured or desperate are met with bombs raining down on them. Because all they know is how to kill. I salute the determination of the people of Gaza to not leave their homes and cities on behalf of my nation.   
   
When your own homes start to burn, the Western back you leaned on will pull out, and Israel, which has oppressed people and their brothers for 75 years, will be left alone. Israel, mark my words: Just like 500 years ago, Turkey will be the hope for these people, just as it has been for every oppressed when they are in trouble. I reiterate the call I made to the Israeli government in recent days: Do not dull the merciful feelings of the Turkish nation with empty words and attitudes that exceed your stature. Just like your ancestors, your children and their children will also need Turkey in the future. Come today and listen to us to not let their outstretched hands fall. Listen to our call to establish peace by opening the doors for dialogue to meet our request to deliver aid to the oppressed today. 

\#############  
Last week, President Erdogan and top diplomats increased pressure on Israel. The Turkish Foreign Minister said: ""Either there will be a major war or a major peace"".

As a protest, Turkey has canceled plans for joint exploitation of gas reserves in the eastern Mediterranean with Israel and all diplomatic visits between the two countries. Erdogan has clearly supported Hamas, referring to them as freedom fighters and mujahidun, while Turkey does not consider Hamas a terrorist organization.

In the Hagia Sophia, the Director of Religious Affairs of Turkey delivered a Friday sermon with both hands on a sword hilt, which has a traditional meaning and referencing the a conquest period. According to this tradition inherited from the Ottoman era, a sword held in the right hand is meant to intimidate the enemy, while a sword held in the left hand is meant to inspire confidence in allies.

October Hamas-led attack.
Around 4,500 labourers from Gaza were estimated to be in Israel when hundreds of Palestinian fighters stormed Israeli communities near the Gaza Strip, killing around 1400 people.
Despite being in Israel on work permits, they were all rounded up in detention facilities, and repeatedly humiliated and abused according to first-hand accounts.
Workers recently released by Israel told Middle East Eye their work permits had been revoked and they were sent back to Gaza on foot, despite the coastal enclave being under constant bombardment and now subject to an Israeli ground invasion.
In videos circulating online, hundreds of workers are seen returning to Gaza on foot. It is not clear how many of the 4,500 labourers have been released.
The Palestinians told MEE of various abuses in detention, many of which appear to amount to torture.
Since the 7 October attack, anti-Palestinian rhetoric and sentiment has reached an all-time high in Israel. Israeli officials have called for Gaza to be wiped out and urged Palestinians linked with the attack to be tortured.
Meanwhile, attacks on Palestinian citizens of Israel and Palestinians in the occupied West Bank have escalated.

A bit about us:

**Omri**: I'm from Jaffa, and a member of the central committee of the Communist Party. In 2006 I was part of a group of 250 teenagers who refused to serve in the military due to the occupation and was sentenced and served a month in solitary confinement: [https://web.archive.org/web/20080814155519/https://www.afsc.org/israel-palestine/Omri-Evron.htm](https://web.archive.org/web/20080814155519/https://www.afsc.org/israel-palestine/Omri-Evron.htm)

A few years ago I co-authored an article alongside a Palestinian friend of mine from the West Bank for +972 Magazine: [https://www.972mag.com/coresistance-activism-israel-palestine/](https://www.972mag.com/coresistance-activism-israel-palestine/)

I would be happy to answer questions regarding the political situation in Israel, the left-wing and especially the Communist Party and our parliamentary front Hadash/Al-Jabha. Also, feel free to ask me about the challengers and potential of joint Jewish-Arabic, patriotic and internationalist politics in Israel and conversely the crisis of the Zionist Left.

**Peleg**: I'm from Tel-Aviv, and was member of the Communist Party when I lived in Israel. A decade ago I moved back to Germany, where his family is from. Today I'm is a member of ""Jewish Voice for Just Peace in the Middle East"", an organization of German Jews who oppose the colonization & occupation of Palestine and calls for a stop to the oppression of the Palestinian people: [https://www.juedische-stimme.com/#about-info](https://www.juedische-stimme.com/#about-info)

I would be happy to answer questions regarding how Germany treats pro-Palestinian and anti-Zionist acitivities and anything else connected to German politics in regard to Israel/Palestine.

527,179dlp3,2023-10-16,Palestine,Canary mission blacklist of pro-Palestinians,"Canary Mission, the now infamous and anonymous website that blacklists and harasses activists who support Palestinian rights, has over 2,300 profiles of students and professors smearing them for their human rights advocacy. On Twitter, Canary Mission tags students’ employers, graduate school administrators and even the FBI with the explicit intent of ruining career prospects and reputations.(Fahoome, 2018)

Milstein, an Israeli-American real estate investor, as the funder of Canary Mission. Is heard echoing Canary Mission’s strategy in the undercover footage:  

We need to expose what [activists] really are. And we need to expose the fact that they are anti everything we believe in. And we need to put them on the run. We’re doing it by exposing who they are and what they are … Not just anti-Semites, it’s too simple. We need to present them for what they really are. They’re anti-freedom, they’re anti-Christian.(Al Jazeera footage)

Canary Mission’s anonymous founders made clear from the start that their mission was to damage the lives of activists. “It is your duty to ensure that today’s radicals are not tomorrow’s employees,” said an anonymous female voiceover on a promotional video posted to Canary Mission when the site launched. Canary Mission also regularly tweets out false accusations that activists are anti-semitic, terrorists, criminal, or even “fake Jews.”  These tweets have sometimes gone directly to places of employment where targeted activists work.

Today, Canary Mission continues to smear mostly student activists while hiding behind the cover of anonymity. In the face of shifting public opinion against Israel’s illegal occupation, Canary Mission uses a politics of underhandedness, name-calling, and personal attack. In the last year, Canary Mission has compared Palestine activists to white supremacists in an attempt to further demonize activism against the Israeli occupation.(Edits, z.d.)

There do not appear to have been any defamation suits filed against Canary Mission. The authors of the profiles are careful about what they write, and pursuing a lawsuit would place a heavy burden on the plaintiff. “Students who are naturally concerned about the reputational damage of being smeared as a terrorist usually don’t want to go through a public trial, because that only makes it worse,” Jackson wrote in an email. “It’s tough to take on a bully, especially in court. But litigation is not off the table.”(Forward, 2018)



I just wanted to warn everyone about the existence of Canary mission. I couldn't find the right words to explain who they are, what they do and why they do it. Thats why I chose to use articles describing them because there are no words to describe an organisation like that. It baffles me that it isn't illegal. People are getting fired, not accepted at job interview and a whole lot more because of its existence. A simple tweet or Instagram post with just a few likes can even get you on this site. I can tell what they're trying to accomplish by doing this. Making people too afraid to speak up about the genocide the Palestinians by doxxing them making it seem as if they've done something wrong by supporting Palestine.

The point is to keep our facts straight, solidly documented, to have something to respond with when facing unfair debate tactics. The sources have to be as neutral as possible.

**Edits**: A few suggestions from the comments have been integrated. Feel free to keep making them. What matters is having sources that are difficult to attack.

# Responsibility

There is no conflict without its original aggression. Palestinian Arabs said 'no' to partition of the land. When it established itself in 1948, Israel used violence to displace and harm Palestinians - which they call the Nakba.

Here is a [fact sheet](https://imeu.org/article/quick-facts-the-palestinian-nakba) from the Institute for Middle East Understanding. This aggression is what triggered various wars from Arab countries.

# Disproportionate use of force

According to Statista, Palestinians suffered [95% of the human cost](https://www.statista.com/chart/16516/israeli-palestinian-casualties-by-in-gaza-and-the-west-bank/) of the conflict from 2008 to 2020. As one-sided as it gets.

# Dehumanization

As soon as 1843, Zionists started dehumanizing the population of Palestine. The ""land without a people"" line [popped up in public records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_land_without_a_people_for_a_people_without_a_land) for the first time. It suggested that taking the land meant not committing a crime against anyone.

This dehumanization was made crystal clear when Israeli Defence minister Yoav Gallant talked about [fighting ""human animals""](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/09/israel-declares-siege-on-gaza-as-hamas-claims-israeli-strikes-killed-captives) in front of the cameras on October 10, 2023.

# Colonialism

Israel has a [history of building settlements](https://www.britannica.com/place/Israeli-settlement) in occupied territories as a form of expansionism.

Palestine is the obvious go-to territory when it comes to that, but not the only one. After seizing the Sinai from Egypt in the Six-Day war, Israel started [sending](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_occupation_of_the_Sinai_Peninsula#Israeli_settlements_in_Sinai) settlers at [Yamit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamit) and making expansion plans. It took the peace deal with Egypt to get a withdrawal.

Settlements on occupied land are [considered as illegal](https://press.un.org/en/2016/sc12657.doc.htm) according to the UN Security Council. They reduce Palestinian territory and make peace harder to achieve due to the situation on the ground. The UN has [adopted a resolution](https://www.un.org/webcast/pdfs/SRES2334-2016.pdf) in 2016, stating that it must stop.

https://preview.redd.it/jvivn1doqdub1.jpg?width=1341&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1f5bdf31743b3d655045f6def6e58b29712da823

# Settler violence

Palestinians aren't only suffering the loss of land since 1948. The settlers commit violence against Palestinians and the Israeli army protects the attackers.

According to United Nations Human Rights, such violence rose to a [record level in 2022](https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2022/12/israel-un-experts-condemn-record-year-israeli-violence-occupied-west-bank-0) in the West Bank.

# Murder of a journalist

Shireen Abu Akleh, a Palestinian-American journalist who worked for Al Jazeera, was [murdered](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Shireen-Abu-Akleh). Independent investigation showed that she was shot by Israeli forces while covering an operation in Jenin.

Her funeral was [attacked by Israeli police](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-61437601).

# Obstacles to humanitarian aid

Can humanitarian agencies do their job? Not easily. The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine refugees in the near east (UNRWA) [recently complained](https://www.unrwa.org/newsroom/official-statements/matter-life-and-death-water-runs-out-2-million-people-gaza) that clean water is running out in Gaza due to the full blockade.

# Refugees and right of return

Speaking of the UNRWA, its work covers one of the key elements in the cause of Palestine as a condition for a peace settlement. The refugees' right to return home after being displaced.

UNRWA allows refugees to pass on their status to their children and Benjamin Netanyahu [would like the agency to be shut down](https://www.timesofisrael.com/netanyahu-back-us-cuts-to-unrwa-but-says-they-should-be-gradual/), so the status would die with individuals.

# Apartheid

I could tell you that Human Rights Watch considers Israel as an apartheid regime but some will call it biased.

Then, how about the opinion of former Israeli soldiers who personally enforced the occupation? Many of them do NOT agree with the practices of their country. They formed a non-governmental organization called [Breaking the Silence](https://www.breakingthesilence.org.il/), which documents violations and provides guided tours to expose the brutality of Palestinian life.

In an interview, a co-founder of Breaking the Silence [explains what he did](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXiMyQkCPfI) in his time as a soldier, and why he couldn't stand doing it anymore.

The Israeli Information Center for Human Rights in the Occupied Territories [agrees that the regime is apartheid](https://www.btselem.org/publications/fulltext/202101_this_is_apartheid).

Even a former Mossad chief [recently said](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/sep/06/israel-imposing-apartheid-on-palestinians-says-former-mossad-chief) that the country is imposing apartheid on Palestinians.

# Israel's links with Hamas

Is Hamas the enemy of Israel or its ally? Israeli sources such as Times of Israel freely [report](https://www.timesofisrael.com/for-years-netanyahu-propped-up-hamas-now-its-blown-up-in-our-faces/) that Israel has facilitated its rise to weaken the Palestinian Authority which wanted to negotiate peace, divide the Palestinians and have a convenient enemy.

Also, an Israeli whistleblower lifted the veil on how the country [facilitated violence](https://swprs.org/ari-ben-menashe-on-israeli-black-operations/) on the Palestinian side for the purpose of propaganda.

# Human shields

IDF like to make allegations about Hamas using human shields to expose them to Israeli fire. There is no substantial evidence of this at all. For example, investigating into the 2014 war on Gaza, Amnesty International [found no proof](https://www.amnesty.org/en/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/MDE2111782015ENGLISH.pdf#%5B%7B%22num%22%3A102%2C%22gen%22%3A0%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22XYZ%22%7D%2C82%2C551%2C0%5D) of such a practice.

# Two-state solution

Who wants this? Britannica [reminds us](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Oslo-Accords) that Palestine signed the Oslo Accords in the 1990s but that Israel's domestic politics interfered with the implementation. The deadline set for 1999 to negotiate a final-status agreement to create an internationally-recognized State of Palestine was not met, creating distrust on the Palestinian side.

As a result, the Palestinian Authority that was supposed to be temporary turned into a more permanent outfit. Ariel Sharon provoked the Second Intifada with a visit to the Al-Aqsa Mosque. Israel tightened occupation.

Later, Israel withdrew from Gaza without an agreement and sealed it from the world. As a previous point shows, it also turned Hamas into a convenient enemy. Thus, Israel abandoned the two-state solution willingly.

# West Bank annexation

As if the intention not to make peace deals wasn't clear enough, Israel broke international law even further with the [administrative annexation](https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/06/08/israel-palestine-west-bank-annexation-netanyahu-smotrich-far-right/) of the West Bank to a civil authority in 2023.

# Indigenous

Jews say that they were exclusively first on the land but it's not true. [Studies](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/article/dna-from-biblical-canaanites-lives-modern-arabs-jews) reveal that the two populations in the land of Palestine, including the Palestinians, are historical descendants of the Canaanite. In other words, closely related.

# Logical fallacies

Some Zionists use false logic to clamp down on public debate. They create diversions to obscure how overwhelming force and violations of humans rights have been used to crush Palestinians for 75 years.

* ""You criticize us, so you are antisemitic"" although what you want is the end of occupation.
* ""You are saying that it's OK to kill civilians"" although you don't like it.
* ""There have been no elections in Palestine in years"" although the conditions haven't been there to hold them.

571,17tnpey,2023-11-12,Palestine,Hasbara propaganda uncovered!,"Zionists fund [web brigades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troll_farm) to spread their narrative, discredit the counter-narrative, and distract the public from reacting to their atrocities. It is important to spread awareness of their fallacies and propaganda techniques so they become ineffective when deployed against the general public.

[^(Example)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hasbara_Fellowships)

## [Gatekeeping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gatekeeping_(communication)#Gatekeeping_found_in_social_media)

Censorship of anti-Israel content, especially that exposes their lies. Well-known on social media Platform like Facebook Instagram, subreddits that supposed to be a journalistic and unbiased. Troll farms are also involved by downvoting such content, examples can be found by sorting posts/comments by controversial on several subreddits.

## [Sock puppet accounts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sock_puppet_account)

Zionists create new accounts on social media for the sole purpose of spreading propaganda, they also purchase older accounts to disguise this fact

## [Firehose of falsehood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firehose_of_falsehood)

&#x200B;

>*The amount of energy needed to refute bullshit is an order of magnitude bigger than that needed to produce it. --* [*Brandolini's\_law*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandolini%27s_law)

This is one of the most common and effective Hasbara propaganda techniques. Bots, troll farms, and even some journalists and politicians today are repeating the same lies even that it has been already debunked, which weaponize [Illusory truth effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illusory_truth_effect) to create a [Big lie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_lie) that will be difficult to convince people of its falsehood, and overwhelm those who try to refute the lies with a large number of them.

From the linked Wikipedia article:

>The high volume of messages, the use of multiple channels, and the use of internet bots and fake accounts are effective because people are more likely to believe a story when it appears to have been reported by multiple sources.

**Examples of arguments that are still repeated despite being already refuted:**

* [Hamas beheaded babies and raped women](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/israeli-army-says-it-does-not-have-confirmation-about-allegations-that-hamas-beheaded-babies-/3014787) [\[2\]](https://theintercept.com/2023/10/11/israel-hamas-disinformation/)
* [..threaten women of rape](https://www.reuters.com/fact-check/video-captured-woman-mistranslates-captor-threatening-rape-2023-11-08)
* [..uses hospitals for military activity](https://www.democracynow.org/2023/10/30/gaza_hospitals)   
* [Israel did not target Al-Ahli hospital](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/19/what-hit-ahli-hospital-in-gaza)  

## [Shooting the messenger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_the_messenger)

They try to discredit the statement by [assasinating the character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_assassination) of whoever dare call their atrocities out, include [Tu quoqe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tu_quoque) arguments, to distract people with supposed speaker hypocrisy.

**Examples:**

*Erdogan condemn of genocide in Gaza*

Zionists: ""Erdogan is an autocrat""

## [Guilt by association fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_fallacy)

Example: ""Some Hamas leaders live n Qatar; Al Jazeera is a Qatari media outlet; therefor Al Jazeera is supporting terrorism, should be disregarded and prevented from covering.""

## [Presumption of guilt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presumption_of_guilt)

One of the most notable examples is Piers Morgan interview with Bassem Youssef, when he figure his position is difficult to defend, he says something along ""Many things happened and we cannot be sure"".

You would notice that this kind of argument is used in a way that implies [appeal to ignorance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_ignorance): ""We don't know so we cannot reject Israeli narrative"" and ""We don't know so we cannot accept Hamas narrative"", which is a way to try [shifting the burden of proof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burden_of_proof_(philosophy)#Shifting_the_burden_of_proof) for the party they defend.

## [Demonizing / Dehumanization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demonizing_the_enemy)

No sane human would accept intentionally massacring innocents.

But what about killing ""**human animals**"" who would ""**behead babies**"", ""**rape women**"" and ""**commit horrific atrocities**"" while Israel only ""**caused collateral civilian causalities**""?

When people get addresses with this carefully picked words to augment the attacks by Hamas and downplay the genocide by IOF, they think: ""Sure, Kill all of them!""

Demonizing Palestinians is an attempt to demoralize any sympathy toward the victims and enabling massacre against them.

**Examples:**

“I have ordered a complete siege on the Gaza Strip. There will be no electricity, no food, no fuel, everything is closed. We are fighting human animals and we are acting accordingly,” Israel’s defense minister Yoav Gallant said.

## [Straw man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man)

We can talk about how Zionists attack the strawman all ~~night~~ ~~week~~ century and won't finish.

From the linked Wikipedia article:

>The typical straw man argument creates the illusion of having refuted or defeated an opponent's proposition through the covert replacement of it with a different proposition (i.e., ""stand up a straw man"") and the subsequent refutation of that false argument (""knock down a straw man"") instead of the opponent's proposition.

**Examples:**

>""It is important to also recognize the attacks by Hamas did not happen in a vacuum,” Guterres said. “The Palestinian people have been subjected to 56 years of suffocating occupation. They have seen their land steadily devoured by settlements and plagued by violence; their economy stifled; their people displaced and their homes demolished.”

Zionists: Guterres is defending terrorism!

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

>""From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free

Zionists: They are calling for killing of all the Jews!

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

*Waving the flag of Palestine*

Zionists: They are glorifying terrorism / antisemitism!

All of Ireland's MEPs criticised her comments too. As a country that suffered 800 years of colonialism and still has a region that's part of the UK with sectarian tensions, Ireland is the only western country whose leaders and people truly get it. You can always count on Ireland to not blindly side with Israel and say things exactly how they are.

That said, I still think Hamas, Hezbollah and other Islamists are hurting Palestinians more than they hurt the Israeli state. These recent events have achieved nothing for Palestine except create a PR war which seems unlikely to achieve any meaningful results. If all they wanted was to martyr gazans to make Israel look bad, they just needed to stick to a strictly military operation and focus on holding land. Taking the opportunity to massacre civilians achieved absolutely nothing except give Israel justification to commit war crimes with impunity and some PR cover.

If Ireland's experience is anything to go by, diplomacy and public pressure goes A LOT further to achieving peace and prosperity than terrorism. Kick the Islamists to the curb and you'll go a lot further.",partyatmygaff,t2_18ypfui9,0.94,411,91

581,17h9g2v,2023-10-26,Palestine,I was asked to send the screenshotted email to ~300 people in my department. I won’t. How do I say no without losing my job?,"
I am an executive assistant to the Director of our department, so I send emails to the entire department at his request from time to time. Without getting too detailed, my employer is one of the best known in their industry worldwide, and the president sent a company-wide email shortly after October 7 regarding the “attack” carried out on Israel. There has been zero communication or acknowledgment from leadership about the crisis in Gaza since. Again, without getting too detailed, our community is full of people from all over the world and we have many people who have strong negative opinions about Israel and ties to Palestine, and my boss even has a Palestinian and an Israeli working under him. Important to note that my boss grew up in apartheid South Africa and was a draft dodger. We are located in the US. 

I received these emails this morning. The person who sent it got permission from my boss and two other department heads to send out her GFM request. The person who was included on the email with me sent it out to her department almost immediately, and there has been 2 follow up emails to see if it had been sent out to my department/community. I don’t want to say no directly to the person who sent it, but I definitely want to have this conversation with my boss. Something along the lines of: Genuinely what message do you think this sends to your community? Who have not seen a single message from administration about what is happening to Palestinians, right now, today, yesterday, the day before?? How do you think our many many Arabic trainees and employees will feel seeing us lamenting about the loss of stability and community and homes in Israel and still say nothing about what they are doing to innocent Palestinians in Gaza and have been for decades?  I feel for the family of my coworker and I hope they are safe and on the way to recovery. That being said, over 6,000 Palestinians have died in the three weeks since this happened and they already raised $70k out of $300k to pay for expenses in a country with free fucking healthcare and stolen homes.

Anyway, how do I get all of this across without getting fired? Seeing as my boss is an apartheid draft dodger I expected him to be better about this and I’m very disappointed. I will not send this email and let anyone in our department think that I support this language, narrative of events, or Israel.",starsnowsea,t2_nzcxp8ja,0.94,408,128

Hamas let some hostages go and one spoke saying Hamas treated them well they ate the same food as each other and they never laid a hand on them. After seeing how Gaza looks with how blocked it is and hearing how Israel is manipulating the media. How are we still falling for this? We know what comes from war which is propaganda. Israel is arguing with celebrities! Why is it Gaza that’s being shown getting destroyed while Israel is making cookies for soldiers?


(Edit: So from an American point of view it’s hard to find the right things in the story about the old lady who got released. I couldn’t find the story in news stories that are supposed to be trustworthy or on any news website that was shown to me. I found most of this out on TikTok and they gave good proof and even educated me not only on the land of Palestine but on also my religion (I’m Baptist Christian) I’m not even sure if I can find this anymore but it was a person biblical people today people and it showed that Israel even admits and knows that Palestinians have a very good claim to the land.


When Israel bombed the Baptist church and holy places it was a level of disrespect and no care in the world. I hear about the war crimes that have been committed in the name of protection. it all seems so straightforward.

Israel has a military a very good one they have protection unlike Gaza. It’s like me saying I attacked a baby because it hit me and scratched me how can something so small threaten something so big I understand what Hamas did. I don’t stand for it at all but also I see why Hamas was created after looking at a map and seeing how isolated Gaza is. But sadly good things always turn rotten at some point we see it every day. I see people go on Omegal and talk to those from Israel and it’s disgusting. Honestly, it truly is I saw an Israeli soldier holding up a g** talking about how they proudly took innocent lives of children.

When the Jews rose up against their oppressor, they were also considered “terrorists” for fighting back against a sovereign state. But were they terrorists or were they fighting for their lives and freedom against Nazis? We look back on history and we assume that everything is black and white but were innocent German civilians not killed as well because of their fascist government? Israel is a fascist regime similar to Nazi Germany. They abuse, imprison, murder, and oppress Palestinians every day for decades. They brand them with different colored passports, cut off their water supply whenever they feel like it, bulldoze their homes and olive trees, and trap them in a 25 x 7 mile strip of land without the ability to trade goods or travel freely. How can we expect people to live under these conditions and not snap in trying to fight for basic human rights? What would the “terrorist” Jews who rose up against a fascist government think of what Israel is doing to Palestine? Israeli people must wake up and realize that their government is not the Jews in the Warsaw ghetto; their Zionist government is Nazi Germany in this story. Zionism is not true Judaism, as we have seen by thousands of good Jewish people protesting against the Israeli government’s brutality. Their government is responsible for both Israeli and Palestinian deaths.  Their government is not Ireland; they are England. Their government is not the Native Americans; they are the European colonizers. They are the bad guys in this story.

Edit: Some people seem to be misunderstanding the point of my post. I do not condone violence from anybody ever. My point is not everything is black and white. The lines are blurred. For example, who is considered a civilian in Israel (other than children), a country with universal conscription? Was the 20 year old man at the festival one day the same 20 year old man in an IDF uniform 6 months prior who was beating a Palestinian boy almost to death? If it’s more palatable to think of another comparison, go read about Ireland in their resistance against England.

# "" The Palestinians were offered their own state multiple times but rejected it ""

This is a crass characterisation. The first 'offer' was viewed by Arabs as an attempt to legitimise ethnic cleansing. The first partition was proposed by the [Peel Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peel_Commission) in 1937 and then voted through by the UN in 1947. The [Arab representatives objected](https://www.un.org/unispal/document/auto-insert-212035/) on the basis that:

* It would result in the eviction of many palestinians from their homes, pushing them out into the hills of the west bank
* Arabs were seeking a shared state where all religious groups were respected. They had been [repeatedly assured](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McMahon%E2%80%93Hussein_Correspondence) that the [Balfour declaration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration) meant Jewish non-discrimination, not an ethno-state.
* Although Arabs outnumbered Jews 2:1, the partition gave the Jewish state 60% of the land

Once the [resolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Partition_Plan_for_Palestine) was passed, a [civil war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1947%E2%80%931948_civil_war_in_Mandatory_Palestine) occured. 500 Palestinian towns were destroyed, and 800,000 arabs fled into neighbouring countries, an event known as the Nakba ( ""catastrophe"" ). As a result, the neighbouring arab countries declared war in an attempt to prevent the unfolding genocide. Here is the [Arab Justification of War](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Cablegram_from_the_Secretary-General_of_the_League_of_Arab_States_to_the_Secretary-General_of_the_United_Nations) to the UN:

""*... the only fair and just solution to the problem of Palestine is the creation of United State of Palestine based upon the democratic principles which will enable all its inhabitants to enjoy equality before the law...*""

The next effort at a 2-state solution was the Oslo accords in 1993. The Oslo accords were not an agreement on the final 2-state solution. Rather, it created a palestinian autonomy and recognised negotiating partner as the basis for future negotiations. It created a **temporary** arrangement of [who-controls-what](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bank_Areas_in_the_Oslo_II_Accord) in the west bank. The intention was that Israel would slowly withdraw from the west bank, removing settlements and transferring authority to the Palestinians. The early days of the Oslo accords saw some progress. However, due to mistrust on both sides, the [Oslo accords failed](https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/why-the-oslo-accords-failed/) and Israel restarted settlement building. Many Palestinians believe the Oslo accords legitimised the [apartheid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2ZOvxR1X4g&t=6) system that still operates today, restricting their freedom of movement, employment and residency, while ensuring that enclaves cannot expand organically or connect.

Things deteriorated under Netanyahu, whose clear intention was to annex all of the west bank. Strategic placement of settlements allowed for increased isolation of enclaves and Isreali control over water supplies and major roadways. [Here](https://youtu.be/mvqCWvi-nFo?si=ivqUTnIuK6VF9edO) is Netanyahu mocking the Oslo accords, explaining how he undermined it by exploiting the ambiguity of the term 'military facility', and mocking the west for supporting him. This all serves as a depressing lesson about how peace agreements can be weaponised.

In 2008, Isreali priminister  [Olmert offered Abbas 93% of the west bank](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/ehud-olmert-s-peace-offer). But Abbas didnt commit to it, preferring future talks and scrutiny of the map. A major sticking-point was the full right-of-return of the 5 million [refugees](https://www.unrwa.org/palestine-refugees). Israel does not want to allow this and risk losing a Jewish majority. Nonetheless, both sides were converging to a finalized agreement. However, Netanyahu was staunchly opposed to it and he scrapped it immediately upon re-election.

Netanyahu has [accelerated](https://www.ohchr.org/en/news/2023/03/human-rights-council-hears-current-israeli-plan-double-settler-population-occupied) the building of settlements in the west bank, hoping to place a 2-state solution beyond the realms of possibility. There have been no serious efforts at a 2-state solution since then, as Palestinians rightly do not trust his intentions. Until Netanyahu leaves office, trust cannot be restored.

# "" Palestinians must first condemn Hamas, then we'll talk ""

It is unrealistic to expect this. It's easy to condemn Hamas from a position of safety, but suicidal for those caught up in the conflict. There are practical limits to what can be said publicly, even by those who want peace.

This is mirrored on the Western side. You may surely have noticed that western governments refuse to condemn Israel or condemn genocide, and frequently block UN resolutions. And yet, paradoxically, Western governments have a strong interest in a negotiated peace settlement as they seek the stability of their allies. They view public condemnation of Israel as counter-productive, preferring instead private diplomatic pressure. This tension was on full display [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LRjy17ce34).

So just as we should refrain from painting the west as genocide-supporting maniacs, we should also grant the Palestinians the same leeway. We cannot demand that the PNA spark another [civil war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatah%E2%80%93Hamas_conflict) with Hamas as a precondition for peace-talks. Palestinians have no leverage, no power, and no legitimate route to solutions. You cannot require they deradicalise and disarm while they live in such crisis and desperation. We should call out these demands for what they are -  excuses.

&#x200B;

# "" Hamas are Terrorists. Their charter calls for eradicating jews. They cannot be negotiated with. ""

This conflict predates Hamas. The framing of this long conflict as a fight-against-terror is a deliberate attempt to convince you that negotiation is impossible. A hallmark of terrorism is the targeting of civilians. This is atrocious, inexcusable and depressingly - all too common. Nearly every conflict around the world is doing just that, but we shouldn't then conclude that negotiations are off-the-table. Russia also targets civilians, but wouldn't you want a negotiated settlement between Russia and Ukraine?

While the UK and USA have proscribed [Hamas](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/what-hamas) as a terrorist group, this designation has been [controversial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osr_1ySuF6A) even amongst US and UK lawmakers. Designating a governing body as a terrorist organization only serves to close diplomatic routes and further entrench radicalisation. To quote the UK lawmaker Sir Gerald Kaufman:

""*Hamas is a deeply nasty organization, but it was democratically elected and it's the only game in town. The boycotting of Hamas by our own government has been a culpuble error from which dreadful consequences have followed.*""

And to quote the great Isreali Priminister Moshe Dayan:

"" *If you want to make peace, you don't talk to your friends. You talk to your enemies. ""*

While their charter is indeed poisonous, a piece of paper written decades ago is not an eternal representation of their aims, neither are Hamas a homogeneous organization. In 2014, Hamas formed a [unity government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Hamdallah_Government) with the PNA in an effort to restart negotiations with Israel.  The European Union, the United Nations, the United States, China, India, Russia and Turkey all agreed to work with the new government. Israel refused. In 2018, Hamas endorsed an entire year of peaceful protests - the [March of Return](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018%E2%80%932019_Gaza_border_protests). Israel responded by saying that Hamas are using 'Human Shields', and Israeli sniper fire resulted in thousands of [casualties](https://www.unrwa.org/campaign/gaza-great-march-return) including unarmed children and 227 UNRWA students.

We must stop this hyper-fixation on an old document. The focus on poisonous rhetoric is a blatant attempt to deflect attention away from moderate voices, and to paint the other side as non-negotiable. Radical rhetoric exists on both sides, but if Palestinians could see good faith efforts being made by Israel, it would certainly cool down the rhetoric.

&#x200B;

# ""We want to live side-by-side in peace, but they hate us too much""

There is indeed an intense hatred of jewish people in the region. This must not be understated. But there is also intense hatred of Palestinians amongst Isreali settlers. Attacks on Palestinians are rife in the west-bank. A clear indication of the intensity of this hatred is [Baruch Goldstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baruch_Goldstein). In 1994, he entered a mosque and [massacred](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_of_the_Patriarchs_massacre) palestinians engaged in peaceful prayer.  He killed 29 people, several as young as 12 years, and wounded 125. A poll found that only 78.8% of Israeli adults condemned the Hebron massacre.  Goldstein was even venerated by some, and his gravestone became a shrine and site of pilgrimage. Thankfully, the Isreali government responded by dismantling the shrine and banning terrorist monuments.

The point is that the hatred is extreme on both sides. This hatred is not innate. Nobody is born with such hatred. It is the result of a broken system which pits one ethnic group against another. Israel is a small country. It's small enough that every single person, Jewish or Palestinian, has lost family to sectarian violence. Every single Gazan is traumatized.

Systemic reform must be the solution to cool the hatred. And this is almost entirely in Israel's hands. They have the power. They have one of the strongest militaries and security services in the world. They have economic power and the backing of the West. They can reform it.

What's needed is political will. Unfortunately, there is not a lot of that in the current Isreali government. Netanyahu's grip on power is tenuous, riddled by corruption scandals and unpopular 'judicial reforms', he relies on a fringe cooalition of far-right whack-jobs. His defense minister [Itamar Ben-Gvir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itamar_Ben-Gvir) is a convicted criminal who boasts having a portrait of [Baruch Goldstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baruch_Goldstein) in his living room. Netanyahu must go.

&#x200B;

# "" Gaza is not under occupation ""

* The land, sea and air borders is under lockdown for the past 20 years.
* The water, electricity and imports are controlled by Israel
* According to wikileaks, Israel calculates the calorific requirement of the gaza strip to keep gaza on the 'brink of collapse'
* Israel [steals Gaza's water](https://climate-diplomacy.org/case-studies/israel-palestine-water-sharing-conflict) and sells it back to them. They do this by building deep wells around the Gazan border, sucking out the ground-water from Gaza. The result is that Gaza's own tap water is undrinkable, contaminated by raw sewage and sea water. Many in Gaza cannot afford to buy clean water. 25% of illnesses in Gaza is caused by tap water. Gaza has constant cholera outbreaks as a result.

&#x200B;

# "" Israel gave them Gaza in good faith, and look how that worked out for them ""

The 2005 [disengagement from gaza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_disengagement_from_Gaza) was based on demographic engineering. The core issue is that a democratic jewish state requires a majority jewish population. But there are more Muslims than Jews in the region. So Israel needs to expel muslims and draw it's borders around any community that is majority muslim. Palestinians are first and foremost a **demographic** threat.

The Israeli priminister Olmert put it quite eloquently:

""*More and more Palestinians are uninterested in a negotiated, two-state solution, because they want to change the essence of the conflict from an Algerian paradigm to a South African one. From a struggle against 'occupation,' in their parlance, to a struggle for one-man-one-vote. That is, of course, a much cleaner struggle, a much more popular struggle – and ultimately a much more powerful one. For us, it would mean the end of the Jewish state. The parameters of a unilateral solution are: To maximize the number of Jews; to minimize the number of Palestinians.*""

Israel regards palestinian integration and equal rights as an existential threat. This is also why palestinian enclaves in the west bank are isolated. But it must be recognized that these concerns are legitimate. Jewish people have been subjected historically to discriminiation. It would be a tough task to convince them to give up on a Jewish Homeland. It is a real fear that full palestinian integration would result eventually in an Islamic state. That's why a 2-state solution has been the focus of all peace negotiations. A solution which respects Isreal's right to exist as a jewish state, while granting Palestinians a sovereign state.

&#x200B;

# "" Hamas uses human shields ""

Hamas do not control the airspace. They cant just go set up in an open field somewhere. They have to hide to survive.

&#x200B;

# "" Israel are 'minimising civilian casualties' ""

If their strategy is to eradicate terrorism by bombing a city, then they are not minimising civilian casualties. You cannot bomb terrorism away, unless you kill everyone. Phoning sometimes with a bomb-warning rings pretty hollow in this context.

&#x200B;

# "" So you think the attack on the 7th Oct was justified ?!!!???  ""

The massacre on the 7th was absolutely disgusting. Everyone must be held accountable. Not just those who were directly involved, but also everyone who has been complicit in allowing this atrocity to occur.

Those who object to Israel are not justifying or glorifying terrorism. We are demanding FULL accountablility. Not just of Hamas, but of the governments who have repeatedly disregarded peace efforts. Netanyahu held peace in the palm of his hand, and he threw it away. He mocked it. He promised to bring 'fear and collapse' upon palestinians. He must be held accountable also.

&#x200B;

# "" A peaceful Solution is impossible. ""

Wrong. This is the dangerous lie we must overcome. We must remember that Olmert came very close to a deal in 2008 before Netanyahu scrapped it. Many in Israel support a solution. Amongst Isreali voting citizens, 21% are Arab. Netanyahu clings to power with a fragile cooalition of fringe parties. Netanyahu is pollitically doomed and Isreali's have an opportunity to unite around a single candidate with a clear mandate for peace. 

There is a split opinion about whether a 2-state or [1-state](https://www.odsi.co/en/) (Binational) solution is best. However, everybody desires an immediate and meaningful improvement to their lives. There are many positive measures we can seek which which keep the door open for either solution. Efforts towards a 2-state solution will also bring a Binational solution closer. Realistically, any 2-state solution would require a somewhat permeable border, with close economic cooperation and sharing of infrastructure.

It will not happen immediately. It will take decades to implement. Israel cannot open it's borders in the near-term. A major sticking point for Israel are their defence concerns. The west bank is geographically a nightmare to control. There is the worry that concessions will only allow militants to gain strength. Isreal must be re-assured of it's national security by the international community.

The immediate priority should be to:

* stabilize the situation -  obtain a ceasefire and huminatarian aid
* Demonstrate good faith and shape public opinion
* Negotiations on incremental improvements, with close cooperation of public messaging

There are many things Israel can do unilaterally to demonstrate good faith:

* Netanyahu must go, and be replaced with a leader the palestinians could trust. His time is up anyway, he was deeply unpopular before this attack, and many Israeli's hold him partially responsible.
* Announce a halt to settlements. Dismantle the smallest settlements.
* Incentives for settlers to sell-up, such as subsidies
* Allow some palestinian enclaves to connect and expand organically
* Withdraw the \~500 setllers from Hebron and and dismantle the oppressive security structure there
* Seek a neutral UN peacekeeping force in the west bank in areas of high tension
* Stop over-extracting the ground-water around Gaza
* Reform the graded [ID system](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2ZOvxR1X4g), which currently only allows palestinians to downgrade their residential status
* Reform the selective policing of sectarian violence
* Cool the rhetoric

And what does Israel get in return for this?:

* A reformation of the Hamas charter
* A change to public rhetoric
* A ceasefire
* Hostages back

It may not be possible to agree to everything all at once. This is the end goal which would have to be implemented in a careful step-by-step manner.  Peace is a process, not a single legal agreement. At each stage, each side must be very careful not to push beyond the limits of public opinion. Public opinion limits what each side can offer at each stage. Hamas cannot change their charter immediately, as the leader would be swiftly removed. Neither can the new Israel prime minister annouce all those concessions immediately as he wouldnt have the political support.

It is critical to avoid careless messaging that could stoke mistrust. Every action must be preceded with careful PR. And Isreal must lead each step with a good faith unilateral measure to build trust. The international community must step up and play their part. Israel is rightly concerned about it's security. And rightly worried that concessions will grant too much leverage to their enemies. The USA must do everything possible to reassure Israel of it's security throughout the peace-process in order to prevent a spiral of mistrust.

Given the amount of atrocities and hatred on both sides, it is challenging, but not impossible, to get public opinion to shift towards trust and hope. The narrative needs to change towards focusing on the NEXT generation. We cannot allow another generation of people to be born into stateless misery. We must work towards a solution that brings a better life for the innocent unborn. They bear no responsibility for the 7/10 attack and we should always remind people of that.

They still just take the position of the status quo.

This is in contrast to the Ukrainian war which despite the fact that there are have also been atrocities on both sides people are fine with taking a side so it's not that they're afraid to take a side it's that they are afraid to be against Israel. Now I will admit that I don't know if these particular people are both for Ukraine and for Israel but it should be noted that people in general are not afraid to take sides in conflicts they have no pardon but instead that they simply just want to be a simp for the United States.

I mean come on, so people can admit that there have been atrocities on both sides and yet they still support the status quo? Sorry but if you support doing absolutely nothing in this scenario except to watch then you are supporting the oppression.

People don't have any actual solution for the Palestinians when it comes to what they should do. People have no solution. They just want them to roll over and die.

They're not outright saying it but they're basically saying that you should either die and I mean everyone should die if a certain organization that shares your ethnicity commits atrocities.

Man that's going to be really awkward when people find out that America has been doing that since forever.

Honestly I have more respect for those that outright declare their hatred of Palestinians than those that tried to claim some kind of humanitarians superiority of neutrality because at least those people are honest.",Arktikos02,t2_r7uww8zo,0.91,341,74

657,17o6750,2023-11-05,AskMiddleEast,What are Muslim countries doing for Palestine?,"🇦🇪(UAE): Attempting to sell themselves as a 'Middle Eastern Switzerland'. Have used their influencers and religious leaders to discourage boycotts and protests. Many in the government think they are being attacked by Iran/Muslim Brotherhood – believe they are the victim of a conspiracy to derail their ties with Israel. To counter the criticism they are getting, spearheading efforts in the UN to support Palestine. 

🇸🇦(Saudi): Very busy in events and the pursuit of Vision 2030. Shakira is coming, she takes precedence. Doing basic back-channel diplomacy, but not concerned with Palestine. Secretly hoping America takes out Iran, but do not want a BIG war that brings their key assets like oil plants, desalination plants, airports or seaports under fire. A policy of doing the bare minimum.

🇹🇷(Turkey): Erdoğan says one thing, does another. Local elections are coming up, appealing to his voter base with critique of Israel. Still exporting goods and oil to Israel. A policy of speeches, and then more harsher speeches.

🇯🇴(Jordan): As always in the pocket of America, doing some public condemnation of Israel, but policy has not changed. Calling for installation of air defenses and supporting an American air-bridge to Israel. Tear-gassing protestors and pushing local religious leaders to tell people to stop voicing concern for Palestinians.

🇪🇬(Egypt): Sisi, thinking similar to the Emiratis, wants Hamas gone. Initially allowed protests, now heavily clamping down. Fears public pressure, but militarily assisting Israel. Does not want a Tahrir 2.0, but also does not want to upset his American patrons. Concerned about Israel's plan to push 2.2 million Gazans into the Sinai desert, but might be willing to capitulate for the right price.

🇧🇭 (Bahrain): Working in lockstep with the UAE. Attempting to avoid public attention. Waiting for everything to roll over, so they can go back to normal. As always, offering lip service to Palestine.

🇩🇿(Algeria): Occupied with planting trees and domestic issues currently. Not wanting to recognize the Palestinian issue. After much domestic pushback, the government issued statements in favor of Palestine. A ‘doesn’t concern me’ policy currently.

🇶🇦 (Qatar): Facilitating hostage negotiations and making big attempts to avoid a regional war. Doing their best given the unprecedented amount of American pressure upon them. 

🇰🇼 (Kuwait): Among the most loud and loyal to the Palestinian cause. Financially and politically and socially providing support to Palestinians. Encouraging boycotts, protests, and all forms of solidarity.

🇮🇷/🇱🇧 (Iran/Lebanon): The key players in this entire thing. Working closely with proxies to help the Palestinian cause militarily. Taking a major risk to itself and others to strategically defeat the West and to liberate Palestine. Implementing decades long plan to remove the USA from the region.

🇸🇾(Syria): Working to defend itself while supporting its local and regional partners. Does not have much to fight with but committed to a big war to defend Palestine if it breaks out.

🇾🇪(Yemen): Finger on the trigger, looking forward to inflicting a loss on the Saudis, Israelis, and everyone else they think they've been wronged by. Increasing their presence in the war, have shot above American naval assets and has used ballistic missiles.

Also, to note:

1. The Muslim countries all feel like they are on a poker table waiting for someone to make a move. There is talk of expelling Israeli ambassadors, but everyone is waiting for someone else to do it.

695,17gl8p3,2023-10-26,AskMiddleEast,I used to be pro-Palestinian until I met... (true story - hope this can inspire you too),"I used to be pro-Palestinian. I thought Israel was wrong for carpet bombing Gaza and using siege warfare on civilians.

But then I ran into a very wise Israel apologist who changed my way of looking at things forever.

I was walking down the street and I saw him leaning against a lamp post, smoking a pipe as wise men do.

“Your shirt says Free Palestine,” he said from behind a plume of smoke.

“Yep!” I replied.

“So I guess that means you love Hamas then?” spake he.

I stopped in my tracks. I’d never thought of it that way before.

Could it be? Could my opposition to murdering civilians really be indicative of a deep affection for a Gazan militant group? Maybe I really did love Hamas and think everything it did on October 7 was great and wonderful?

“Is this really how I want to live my life?” I thought to myself.

“I — I — I…” I said out loud.

“Or perhaps,” he said with a raised eyebrow, “you just HATE JEWS??”

I fell to my knees.

Oh my God. He really had a point. What possible reason could anyone have for opposing military explosives being dropped on buildings full of children besides a seething lifelong hatred of adherents to the religion of Judaism? How could anyone possibly oppose siege warfare tactics which cut off civilians from food and water and electricity and fuel and medical supplies unless they harbored a dangerous hostility toward members of a small Abrahamic faith?

“Who… who are you?” I asked.

“That’s of no consequence,” he said, casually blowing a smoke ring through another larger smoke ring.

“But… but the children,” I stammered as my entire worldview crumbled before my eyes. “The civilians! They’re dying! Isn’t it bad that they’re dying?”

And then he went for the coup de grâce.

“Have you considered,” he said before a pregnant pause, “… that all of those deaths are the fault of Hamas?”

I fell flat on my back. The world was spinning. A trickle of blood ran down into my hair from my ear.

I felt all the anti-colonialism leaving my body. I suddenly could no longer remember why I thought it was bad to rain down military explosives on a densely populated concentration camp.

Everything went black.

When I finally came to, the mysterious stranger was gone. But his wisdom and profound insights into Israel and Gaza will always live on in my heart.

Although we are being persecuted, this does not stop us from supporting Palestine.

It’s so frustrating when they say things like that because (as an Arab Christian) I can tell you most of us don’t support “Israel” at all. Although some Arab Christians have supported “Israel” in the past, this doesn’t prove anything because there are Arab Muslims who have also supported “Israel”. Christian Zionism completely goes against what the Bible teaches and is such a flawed way of reading the Bible. Jesus does not support the oppressor. It genuinely gets on my nerves when Zionists keep on lying and say we support “Israel” because the hard truth is, we don’t. We stand with Palestine.

With these recent events I was disgusted and wanted to search the matter more (historically) to see the Palestinian side and I try to comprehend the problems Palestinias have endured. Now, recently I see a lot of posts that say Israel will probably begin a massive counter attack and almost flatten Gaza and commit a lot of war crimes to innocent people.


Now, I under no circumstances can applause such course of actions. However, if a was a citizen of Israel (actually now too that I am not) and saw these events happen I would want answers and the people that did those actions punished. If Gaza was a normal country with army camps and airforce and navy and attacked Israel that would make it easier so that innocent people would not be killed. However now it is more complicated since most Hamas members live inside cities with innocent civilians inside. 


To sum up, I suppose that most of you wouldn't want for Israel to counterattack at all, however that is really not realistic unfortunately.

What I do want to discuss is his theory that Israel will weaken not because of Arabs but because of the withdrawal of Western support. Most of the narrative surrounding the war is driven by Muslims and their Left allies on TikTok. All the news you see sympathetic to Israel is by cable news and regular broadcasters like CNN, Fox, BBC watched by older audiences. Most young people get their news from Youtube or TikTok which is dominated by left-leaning influencers. Any data will show you that people under 40 in the West including in USA are pro-Palestine. A lot of Israel support is also by evangelicals but that demographic group also in decline due to growing atheism in the young. . 

What do you think? Will West swing to Palestine in a generation due to millennials and Gen Z as they gain power?

736,17dy0m2,2023-10-22,AskMiddleEast,Request/Advice: People are getting doxxed and fired from their jobs for supporting Palestinians.,"Hello,

As some of you might know a lot of people will loose their jobs for their support of Palestine, these people are not Palestinians but common men and women who decided to speak up, I know its not the right time since the genocide is on-going but I can't help but to think about these folks who risked their stability for another people.

&#x200B;

Israeli's and some right wing groups including so called visegrad24 news channel are doxxing protestors and tagging the CEOs of their companies or heads of their school/University, a lot of them will get fired because a lot of their CEOs are pro-Israel.

I am writing this post because I want to express the solidarity both ways, I know it takes a lot of courage to speak up for a just cause and it takes even more courage to speak up for a people of another race/religion.

Now to the topic, is there anyway we can help these folks? give them a platform, a voice, threaten to boycott the products on mass if the company does a witch-hunt? or if nothing else than just help them find alternate jobs? I have no idea how and neither do I have the following to raise the voice own my own, but I am trying my best that is why I need your support if some of you are influencers with a lot of followers or can provide a platform for those affected please do so, spread the word.

&#x200B;

They already got a team lead from Wix fired (Wix is an Israeli company), they are after a 5th year medical student currently studying in Poland, there are so many more.

&#x200B;

I believe its our duty to protect the weak and persecuted, these folks could have just kept their mouth shut and they would have been fine, but they didn't and it takes a lot of humanity and courage we should not leave them alone. Please raise voice on this matter so companies think twice before doing a witch-hunt, if you have higher up contacts then also let them know to hire the people affected so these folks can be employed again ASAP.",Kismet_Valla,t2_ebycg67h,0.89,42,31

I have been looking at sources. The palestine news are saying the police just attacked. The Israel police say that there were protesters who closed themselves off inside the mosque, started turmoil and threw fireworks and rocks around. Would the Israel police really just show up to anger the muslims on their Ramadan? Last week was also Pessah, which is also an important holidy for the Jews, so it seems weird that that's when they would plan their ""attack"". And usually someone has to call the police for them to come. 

Whatever your opinon, please provide a source as to why the police intervened, I'm not interested in hear-say from either one of the polarized sides.

762,17npq95,2023-11-04,AskMiddleEast,Saudi-Israel normalization,"You have probably heard that one of the objectives of the operation, dubbed ""el Aqsa flood,"" was to hinder the Saudi-Israel normalization process that was being brokered by the USA.

Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah—a Lebanese militant group that supports Hamas and is allied with Iran—stated that the assault against Israel sends a message to countries seeking normalization with Israel that “the Palestinian cause is an ever-present one, alive until victory and liberation.”

So let's delve a bit into the demands of Saudi Arabia, and considering the rumors that the negotiations were proceeding well before October 7th, let's examine what Hamas have hindered :

>In exchange for normalising ties with Israel, Saudi Arabia - which positions itself as a leader in the Middle East and the Islamic world - is asking for major military support from the US, co-operation in establishing its own civilian nuclear programme, and significant Israeli concessions to the Palestinians. 

>For us, the Palestinian issue is very important. We need to solve that part,"" Crown Prince Mohammed, who is Saudi Arabia's de facto leader, told Fox News correspondent Bret Baier in English.

>He commented: ""We have a good negotiations strategy till now.""

>If we have a breakthrough, reaching a deal that gives the Palestinians their needs and [making] the region calm

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-66879342

>The team of top Palestinian officials in Riyadh - including the two men seen as closest to President Mahmoud Abbas, the PA's intelligence chief, Majed Faraj, and Hussein al-Sheikh, secretary-general of the Palestine Liberation Organisation - met Saudi national security adviser Musaed al-Aiban on Wednesday, according to a senior Palestinian official familiar with the discussions.

>Their list of demands in return for engaging with the American-backed process was set out during a meeting with US Assistant Secretary of State Barbara Leaf last week in Amman. The Palestinian official told the BBC the demands include:

>Transferring parts of the West Bank currently under full Israeli control (known as Area C under the 1990s Oslo peace accords) to the governance of the Palestinian Authority A ""complete cessation"" of Israeli settlement growth in the West Bank

>Resuming Saudi financial support to the PA, which slowed from 2016 and stopped completely three years ago, to the tune of around $200m (£160m) per year

>Re-opening the US consulate in Jerusalem - the diplomatic mission to the Palestinians - that was shut down by President Donald Trump Resuming US-brokered negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians from where they stopped under then-Secretary of State John Kerry in 2014.

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-66734638

>Netanyahu’s office said afterwards that the meeting “mostly dealt with ways to establish a historic peace agreement between Israel and Saudi Arabia, which could greatly advance an end to the Arab-Israeli conflict and facilitate the establishment of an economic corridor to link Asia, the Middle East and Europe.”

>Ahmad Deeq, of the Palestinian foreign ministry, told Radio Nas: “The Saudis have told us in closed-door meetings and openly that they will [demand] an agreement that is based on the establishment of a sovereign Palestinian state.”

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/sep/21/saudi-arabia-getting-closer-to-normalising-relations-with-israel-crown-prince-says

>On this point, both the United States and Saudi Arabia recognize that there has to be a significant Palestinian component in this process.

>Finally, Saudi ambitions in the region and more broadly in the Islamic world will necessitate that the Palestinian component in the normalization agreement be seen as significant from a Palestinian, Arab and Islamic perspective.

>As for the similarities, it is recognized that Saudi Arabia is more significant for Israel than the Abraham Accord countries. That said, both agreements would rightly be considered transformational in their impact on relations between Israel and countries of the region and beyond.

Why is saudi not saying anthing?

Will saudi have abraham accords? etc.

Here is what I think is MBS's vision.

He wants to make the whole saudi country like a bigger version of dubai, loads more permanent residents, more tourists in several places around the country, worlds best football league, words best event location, worlds best concerts.. everythig basically.

But unlike dubai and israel, saudi is a huge country with hugee borders.

they are surrounded by iranian proxies. iran, yemen, iraq. Bahrain has huge shia population. Qatar friendly with Iran. 

Saudi tried the old ""gonna fuck shit up and delete you from plant earth"" with houthis. They made literally zero achievements. Just muslim world hates saudi more because we saw the famine and destruction caused by the war.

anyway, for vision 2030 to happen Saudi really really really needs a security guarantee in the form nato involving israel, saudi, uae, bahrain and others in the abraham accords.

visiion 2030, if they dont have it secure, the whole thing could be wrecked by the houthis. ""hey mbs, rmember us, here are 2 cruise missles for you, 1 in neom, the other in the cube."" all the investors pull out.

MBS  built his glass palace without first getting the whole security thing in place, and now mbs is desperate to get things over the line and he's willing to pay big price for it.

So Saudi thinks abarham accords > peace > METO > money money money Saudi is mega dubai.

But if saudi thinks that isralis and americans are going to risk their lives of the sons lives to protects MBS big vision. he's really overestimating how much leverage he has over israel and america. To both them, saudi is just a source of energy. Nothbing more, nothing less. Being close to saudi undermines the supposed democratic values they espouse. 

For israel the upsides are better. They have everything to gain and nothing to lose. they open up trade to the muslim world. they can set up shell companies and fronts in saudi and then re-export items to unfriendly countries that still might not want to deal with them.

They can put a saudi director in a saudi company name, have 90% israeli shareholders and for all intents and purposes it looks like a saudi company to the malaysian trading partners.

ThePalestinians have really thrown a curveball in MBS and Israel's plans. More so MBS because he has a deadline to get things done. I really think both saudi and israel are completely OK to try and drive palestinians into the sinai and pay off whayever they need to pay sisi to get this done.

792,17kishm,2023-10-31,AskMiddleEast,The situation in Palestine before October 7th [ narrated by A Gazan ],"Before October 7th, Israel had been bombarding Gaza, and I work at a border school under the UN Relief and Works Agency. We were constantly told to wear loose-fitting clothes to help us escape in case of shelling.

More than half of the students in my class have lost loved ones and witnessed the deaths of martyrs in front of their eyes. That means over most of the students at my school suffer from psychological trauma. We've had to run from the school under random shelling more than once. We've hidden in our classrooms, sitting on the floor, with 40 students, trying to protect them while feeling helpless. We'd return from school on a regular day and find a girl who had been martyred or critically injured in the hospital because an Israeli soldier targeted her in her home.

The residents of Beit Hanoun depend on their agricultural lands near the border, and they've experienced countless tragedies. Their crops have been repeatedly burned, and people have been targeted while peacefully farming.

Before October 7th, Israel would attack peaceful female worshippers in Jerusalem, preventing them from accessing the Al-Aqsa Mosque. They'd engage in provocative celebrations, chanting racist slogans to provoke the people of Jerusalem. Gaza residents need permits to enter the West Bank for education, work, or medical treatment, and they're often denied.

Personally, I'm 32 years old, and I've never visited Jerusalem or any other cities in Palestine.

Critical medical cases needing transfer to the West Bank are often delayed, sometimes leading to the patient's death. Checkpoints are scattered across the West Bank, causing hours of delay. Israel arrests men, women, and children without charges or trial and mistreats and tortures them in prisons. If they're released in rare exchange deals, they're often banished to a distant city away from their families. The settlers occupy homes in the West Bank, displacing Palestinians, who were living there just yesterday.

Even Palestinian citizens within Israel are treated as second-class citizens, facing discrimination and violence from Israeli gangs.

In Gaza, requesting an online item can take up to a year for approval, depending on the mood of the Israeli soldier manning the crossing. Israel often categorizes most of items as dual-use and denies their entry, including materials to build shelters for civilians during wars. I once tried to order scuba goggles, and they were denied because they were considered dual-use. Everything entering Gaza is inspected. Israel regulates food supplies to the point where it barely meets individual needs. It updates these regulations after each war, depending on the population loss due to martyrdom.

Fishermen are frequently shot at sea, and false claims are made that they've approached the border. Their fishing areas are gradually reduced to a tiny space for survival.

This is just a glimpse of the Israeli occupation's practices against Palestinians in general and Gaza in particular.

Israel didn't need October 7th except to provoke people's emotions and remind them of the Jewish tragedy while wiping out Gaza, with the world giving its tacit approval. Without October 7th, Israel would have bombed Gaza and said, ""Gazans deserve it.""

The resistance, tunnels, the Great Return March, and protests are all attempts by the oppressed to defend themselves. Whether they succeeded or failed in their efforts, they're all endeavors to say that we died with dignity, and at the very least, we tried not to let them kill us while they celebrated.

As Naseer Shamma put it, ""Without resistance, your mother would be washing the Israeli soldier's feet in a basin.""

The occupation is not just the enemy of resistance; it's my enemy, my students' enemy, my family's enemy, and my people's enemy. If circumstances allowed, I'd want my children and students to grow up cursing Israel. The battle is far from over.

This is not a justification but a message to those who have started to believe the occupation's repeated narrative that its aim is to eliminate Hamas and remember that Hamas didn't always exist, but my son and yours are still being killed.

Here  are a few notes and resources to help fight this for anyone who many  want some help in this area.  Please check it out, and share the info as  needed in your conversations.  This won't change anything on the ground  today, but information is power.

# ""Muslims / Arabs Hate Jews. // This is a Race War Against Jews""

Contrary  to popular belief, prior to the Zionist project in Palestine,  anti-semitism in Europe was far worse than in the Mid-East.

* In a letter to the Marquis of Salisbury (British PM in 1903), Herzl says:  
""...Our movement is growing, and it is gaining in strength and respectability. And we may thank anti-Semitism for that.""

Many  pro-Israelis love to say ""If the Palestinians put away their guns,  there will be peace, but if the Israelis put down their guns, there will  be Genocide.""  What this is trying to say is that the Israelis are  peace-loving, and the Palestinians are Genocidal.  But let's consider  the history.  Jews lived in the middle-east for centuries prior to  Israel, and did not face the sort of violence that they did in Europe.   Jewish lore speaks of ""The Four Exiles"" which outline the major events  in Jewish history where the Jews were exiled from their lands.  It's  notable that this includes the Greeks and the Romans - forefathers of  modern western civilization.  It's also notable that the Arab and Muslim  empires are NOT considered an exiling nation.

* ""In his work *Ner* *Mitzvah*,  the Maharal of Prague observes that though the Islamic empire was a  'strong and mighty' nation, it is not included among the four exiling  empires."" - [Chabad.org source](https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/3671017/jewish/Discover-the-Four-Exiles-of-the-Jewish-People.htm)

# ""Anti-Zionism is Anti-Semitism""

Zionism  and Judaism are not synonymous.  Zionism is a political ideology  originally devised by European Jews with the intent of establishing a  Jewish State.  This has very little to do with the Jewish Religion  itself.

There exist many Jewish  populations which are not Zionist and which do not support the Israeli  occupation or the slaughter in Gaza.  If the Palestinian position was  anti-semitic, why would any Jews support it?

* [Times of Israel - Jews Protesting Israel](https://www.timesofisrael.com/a-tear-in-the-tent-the-us-jews-who-are-protesting-israel-following-hamas-massacres/)
* [Jewish Voice for Peace - Jewish Anti-Zionist Organization](https://www.jewishvoiceforpeace.org/)

""Palestine was never a country // Palestinians never existed""

Palestine  was an Ottoman territory before it became a British Mandate.  It was  not a country.  However, its population was Arab, and this included  Muslims, Christians, and Jews.  That they had not been an independent  state before WW2 does not entitle Europeans to their land.  This was a  time when many nationalist movements around the world were in their  nascence.  Additionally, people don't have a right to their land by  virtue only of the existence of a nationalist movement or sentiment.   They are entitled to their land as a human right - as expelling people  from their homes in order to replace them with a different race is a  crime against humanity.

This is  not a new war, and the Palestinians do not fight unprovoked, conflict  began before even the state of Israel was established in response to the  ethno-nationalist goals of the European Jews who migrated to Palestine,  it continued through the Great Arab Revolt in the 30's against the  British occupation, through the expulsion of Palestinians in '48 (Al  Nakba / The Catastrophe) during the '48 war, and beyond into the '67 war  and '72 wars which saw further land grabs, and the continued  development of settlements and the subjugation of the people by military  force.

* For something quick and digestible - here's a [Podcast with Israeli Historian - Tom Segev](https://youtu.be/5UnvVlFoPMI?si=8hrpLkPwMXcDbMnd)
* There are many interviews and talks by Pappe online as well.  [Here's one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYIyEEYogNM).
* An excerpt from Ilan Pappe's book:  
""The  orders came with a detailed description of the methods to be  employed  to forcibly evict the people: large-scale intimidation; laying  siege to  and bombarding villages and population centres; setting fire to  homes,  properties and goods; expulsion; demolition; and, finally,  planting  mines among the rubble to prevent any of the expelled  inhabitants from  returning.""

# ""Palestinians Always Reject Peace""

Supporters  of Israeli occupation may claim that the Palestinians rejected the  early partition plan of Palestine, or that they have rejected all of the  ""generous"" peace deals offered by the Israelis.

If  one looks closely, one sees the word-games being played.  The  Palestinians rejecting partition is not a sign of belligerence.  There  exist no people on the face of the planet who would willingly accept the  annexation of even part of their homeland by foreign settlers.  The  Palestinian people have a natural right to sovereignty in their  homeland, free of foreign rule or control.

The  fact that the partition plan was presented by the UN also doesn't  legitimize it - as the Palestinians were not properly represented in the  UN - which makes this a powerful body imposing its will on a weaker  body.  That is settlement colonialism.

* [This is stated in the Palestinian National Charter, 1968](https://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/plocov.asp)

Not  only this, but the Partition plan offered less than half of the land in  Palestine (43%) to the Palestinians, who comprised more than 2/3rds of  the overall population.  While the Jews in Palestine were less than  1/3rd the population and legally owned only about 7% of the land.

* Available in many sources, here's one:  Book - [Stateless Citizenship](https://books.google.com/books?id=eMNkMYmqkdwC&pg=PA126&dq=partition+plan+43+percent&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwig9qK67bbJAhVGpR4KHT3CCJkQ6AEIPTAF#v=onepage&q=%22plan%20also%20bestowed%20upon%20the%20arab%20state%20a%20mere%2043%20percent%20of%20their%20homeland%22&f=false)

An  even more ridiculous claim is the idea that the Palestinians have been  the ones who sabotaged the peace process.  Israeli supports cite the  Palestinian refusal of the Camp David Summit.  What they glaze over is  the fact that the deal was not a deal at all - and accepting it would  have place the Palestinian people into permanent, voluntary  subordination to the Jews.  In effect, it would have legitimized Israeli  occupation of Palestine and ended any hope of Sovereignty.

* A great article on the [myth of Palestinians sabotaging peace deals](https://decolonizepalestine.com/myth/palestinians-sabotaged-the-peace-process/)

There's  a lot more history to this conflict, and yet more context, and swathes  of myths.  The resources above will be useful for at least some of it.

# The Ancient History

The  ancient history is much harder, as records and data aren't always  available.  The Jewish Exile by Romans is a story told mostly through  biblical tradition.  Someone asked about this on another thread so I thought it would be useful to share some info.

Jewish Exile / Roman Evidence

There  is ample debate on this topic, as you seem to have already noticed.   One Jewish historian - Schlomo Sand - disputes the idea entirely.   Stating that there is no documented evidence from the Romans of any  exile, and that the Jews stayed in their kingdom and eventually adopted  Christianity and Islam as those religions rose.  Even if he's wrong, it  does seem that the ""exile"" did not completely remove the ancient Hebrews  from the Area.

* [https://mondediplo.com/2008/09/07israel](https://mondediplo.com/2008/09/07israel)
* ""Then  there is the question of the exile of 70 AD. There has been no real   research into this turning point in Jewish history, the cause of the   diaspora. And for a simple reason: the Romans never exiled any nation   from anywhere on the eastern seaboard of the Mediterranean. Apart from   enslaved prisoners, the population of Judea continued to live on their   lands, even after the destruction of the second temple. Some converted   to Christianity in the 4th century, while the majority embraced Islam   during the 7th century Arab conquest. ""

# Roman Era Expat Jewish Populations

As  far as populations of Jews outside of Palestine around the time of the  alleged Diaspora, it does seem those Jews outnumbered Jews in Palestine.

* [https://www.britannica.com/topic/Diaspora-Judaism](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Diaspora-Judaism)
* ""  Around the 1st century CE an estimated 5,000,000 Jews lived outside   Palestine, about four-fifths of them within the Roman Empire, but they   looked to Palestine as the centre of their religious and cultural life.   Diaspora Jews thus far outnumbered the Jews in Palestine even before  the  destruction of Jerusalem in 70 CE. ""

# Genetics Research

This  isn't touched on so much by your question, but I'll also add that  modern genetics research has shown that the modern Palestinians are very  closely related to modern Jews.  There are several such studies, I've  included one below.

* [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11153918/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11153918/)
* ""  Single-step microsatellite networks of Arab and Jewish haplotypes   revealed a common pool for a large portion of Y chromosomes, suggesting a   relatively recent common ancestry ""

This  would indicate that Arab Palestinians share a common ancestry with many  Jews, which indicates the Palestinians are descended from the ancient  Hebrews, along with other native ancient peoples in the area.  In other  words, exile or not, it seems the ancient Hebrews maintained a  significant presence in Ancient Palestine, adopting new religions and  cultures over time until today.",Zelovian,t2_u373t,0.95,17,8

Why or why not?

I was thinking about this awhile ago.. Most of the MENA users on this subreddit consider Jews in Israel as foreign colonialist invaders. They consider Ashkenazi Jews as European invaders who are not native to the Levant. 

So I thought, would Assyrians who are in diaspora also be considered colonial (in the same way as Jews) if there was a collective Assyrian movement to return to Iraq? Would Assyrian-Americans be considered “foreign American invaders”? 

What would qualify Assyrians in diaspora as foreign or invasive?

That's 6k/11k 100% civilians hamas doesn't take these into its ranks

From the remaining 5k a lot are elderly and considering that the number of hamas is between 15k and 40k in total and there is about 600k+ men in gaza that aren't kids, which means the number of men killed that are part of hamas is between 2.5% of men killed or 6.6% at most, which would be ~125 or at most ~300 without considering the elderly in the 5k.

So there you have it, from the 11k confirmed killed, mathematically it will be maybe 250 actually militants only, which is approx 2.7% of all causilities.

805,1781fui,2023-10-14,AskMiddleEast,"Posted this on r/telaviv, nobody could answer.","Title - I am currently researching the peace treaties that were offered between Israel and Palestine. I would like your perspectives.

As the title says, I am conducting an in-depth analysis of the peace deals that Israel has offered Palestine, as well as peace agreements established by international powers. I am particularly focused on understanding why Palestine has rejected so many peace treaties.

Firstly, I believe that a fair and acceptable peace treaty for Palestine would include the following:

1. Full administrative control of Gaza and the West Bank, including areas A, B, and C.

2. The unconditional removal of all illegal settlements as recognized by the UN.

3. The ability for Palestine to have full control over Palestinian airspace and territorial waters.

4. The capacity for Palestine to establish a fully-fledged military, as every nation has the right to defend itself.

Based on the research I have conducted, it appears that the vast majority of peace treaties were essentially empty talks. Most of the issues important to Palestine were not addressed, leading Palestinians to perceive these agreements as rejections of true peace.

A common theme among peace treaties offered by Israel is that they do not meet any of the criteria listed above. Most of them only allow for limited control over areas A and B, provide no control over area C, and assign sole responsibility for security to the IDF.

If my research is entirely accurate, accepting these peace treaties would effectively maintain the status quo for Palestine, with the only concession being that Israel would cease bombing civilian infrastructure. In such a scenario, it would be entirely reasonable for Palestinians to refuse these peace deals.

My question to you is: Do you consider the criteria listed above as fair for both parties? If not, what would you propose as acceptable criteria for Palestine to have?",twolatefourme,t2_8maqllsfh,0.8,14,16

Patients have been killed, children have been killed, doctors, families, reporters. The UN mission in Gaza is falling apart thanks to the Israeli attacks. There are piles upon piles of bodies with nowhere to bury them. Any attempt to provide aid is being actively blocked by Israel. I know, we all already know this, but just to put everything into perspective. I have never felt so much anger from the news as I have over the past 2 weeks, and I can't even imagine what the people in Gaza must be feeling.

The Arab governments are sitting ducks. Their condemnations will obviously fall on deaf genocidal ears who feel no threat from their neighbors. Outside, the actions have been condemned by some, but nobody is taking any action to stop this massacre. Just as many governments are instead pointing the finger at Hamas, insinuating that they are responsible. The Western media and a significant number of Westerners are backing Israel 100%. Even with all the Pro-Palestine protests worldwide, nobody has done anything to actually give Gazans a break besides a brief ceasefire. Israel has decided to wipe Gaza off the map and nobody is seriously challenging their actions besides Hezbollah.


Is there anything we, the Arab people, can do for Gaza that will actually change anything? Donations are probably not reaching Gaza the way things are. In my heart I would wish the people would just take up arms and join the fight, and I like to imagine that's what most of us would want to do for our brothers and sisters in Gaza, but that is very unlikely and without government support it would be strategic suicide.

As an European (German, 38y.) I have a question. In advance please apologize if my words seem inadequate or probably offensive but as an Autist I sometimes struggle in comunication with others. I am very interested in history and politics. I am following the news since the mid 90s. The conflict in the ME has always been present since that time, sometimes more, sometimes less. For me this seems like a never ending story because I think that realisticly neither the Palestines nor the Israeli will concede any claims or territories. 

What I do not understand is the fact that the Arab and also the Muslim world only cares for the Palestine. Don't get me wrong, it is good that you care as they are your neighbours and you share the same or similar ethnic, religion and (at least for me) culture. When you would ask me what is the difference between Syrians, Irakis, Jordans, Palestines, etc. I could not give an answer. To be fair you would probably say the same about Germans, Dutch and Austrians.

However for me the Arabs fury seems legitimate but on the other hand also very selective. When Palestines and Israelis start fighting and killing each other (again and again) immediate solidarity, anger and even riots occure all over the world.

This leads to my Question: Beside the Palestine-Israel conflict, why are Arabs so passive regarding other conflicts, especially inner-arabian conflicts?

For example:

\- In Syria Alawis, Sunnis, Shias, Kurds, etc. slaughter each other since 2011. Almost 600,000 people manly muslims were killed, millions of refugees had to leave the country.

 \-In Yemen Saudi-Arabia and Iran are fighting a proxy war resulting in 400,000 killed people incl. a temporarily sea blockade which caused a famine. 

\- Civil wars in Iraq (Shia vs. Sunni), Libya, Sudan, Mali, etc.

\- Coup in Egypt, thousands of Mursi supporters were killed

\- PR China commiting genocide on Uighurs

845,1794cdx,2023-10-16,AskMiddleEast,This war will not end without massive israeli concessions.,"The world is waking up to the reality of this conflict. The Palestinians have a righteous cause and the zionists are the oppressors.

1. The zionist entity has killed more children in 8 days than russia has in two years

2. The Zionist Army cannot fight a war in two fronts, while the fascist leaders of the zionist entity continue to beg for more money from their guarantor the USA there is growing dissatisfaction and condemnation at the abhorrent loss of life which is squarely the result of 75 years of Ethnic Cleansing.

3. Westerners are beginning to wake up to the Zionist Entity that they have been supporting their whole life, the difference from ages past is that their Crimes against Humanity are well documented. Everyone has a phone and Camera, the zionist Entity can no longer hide behind manufactured lies conjured up by traditional western media. For this reason alone they are losing the Media War.

4. The only support the zionist entity gets is from Politicians, Businessmen and Media personalities. This shows that the Zionist Entity only has support from the people that have deep political and economic interests in propping them up.

5. In stark contrast most regular people overwhelmingly support the Palestinian cause, It is absolutely blowing up in the faces of the Zionist propaganda machine and no amount of disinformation campaigns can change that. People know what israel is now.

6. The atrocities committed by the Zionist Entity have made our arab peoples closer. All across the arab world people watch in horror as they indiscriminately bomb civilians, even among the states it has normalized relations with such as Emiratis and Moroccans, are having a change of heart.

7. The zionists themselves see no reason to fight a war they cannot possibly win. Hamas Fighters are used to war and being bombed indiscriminately. The Zionist Army are only good at fighting Palestinian civilians who cannot fight back. A ground invasion will be devastating for them and a major failure. 700,000 Zionists are dual citizens, do you think they would fight for an Entity they have no roots in? The Zionist Army is demoralized, they are not ready for an actual war.

8. The Palestinians are fighting for their very existence, through Arabic Social Media I see Palestinians chant “ you will not have your second Nakba” do the zionist really think they can defeat a people with that much resolve?

9. The zionists know it will be the end of their Entity if they actually commit to all out war, you cannot keep people caged for long, at some point neighboring states will be fed up with the continued abuses Palestinians face in Occupied Palestine. People are not their leaders and will act accordingly to what they feel is right.

10. New geopolitical realities will emerge as a result of this war. In decades past the US had a hegemonic role in maintaining a grip on it’s “allies” in the Middle East, the difference now is that China and Russia are powerful compared to 20 years ago. Why have an American Base when I can have a Russian or Chinese base? This war will be a foreign Policy blunder for the west and they will only have themselves to blame for choosing the Settler Colonial Entity as opposed to the Indigenous Palestinians fighting for freedom in their homeland.

The only choice Israel has is to make concessions to the Palestinians and right the wrongs of the past, their economy is failing, their people are fed up with their fascist leader. Refuse and this will be all out war and the end of 75 years of injustice.",SableEmber,t2_m0xfz6oh,0.54,6,38

848,17gbxow,2023-10-25,AskMiddleEast,Thoughts on how the Internet changed Israeli Occupation?,"If we were still in the 1990s and before, there would be no access to the internet in the same form that it exists today. It's interesting to think that because of the internet, there is a discussion on Palestine in the West and many Palestine supporters. The internet allows the whole world to see the truth about the Israeli occupation. We can get live coverage and multiple angles of the same event because so many people have phones and there are many alternative news sources on the internet.

If we were still in the 1990s and before, everyone would be completely brainwashed by the mainstream media, who would be 100% on board with Israel. It's crazy to think that the mainstream media was the only way to get news in the past. Whatever lies the mainstream media said, most people would 100% believe.

I think if this was the 1980s, there would be Israeli flags everywhere (like how it was with Ukrainian flags) and most people would be die-hard Israeli supporters. Statistically, most older people who are 60+ tend to be pro-Israeli in the West, and they grew up in a time that was just like this. They were brainwashed by Israel back in those times, and don't want to change due to nostalgia or whatever silly reasons they have.

Racists and Israelis also had a very easy job back in the 1990s and below, because of the ""terrorist Muslim with an AK-47 and flip flops"" stereotype. All they had to do was show a drawing of their stereotype, and everyone would freak out and support anyone who hated Muslims. There are also many 1980s movies that have a ""terrorist Muslim"" as the villain. It's obvious that those movies were made by racist zionists as propaganda to scare ignorant Westerners.

If there was social media and smartphones like there is today in the 1940s, I think Israel would have a much harder time getting away with the Nakba, and they may have even failed due to international pressure. A lot of the crimes of Israel were hidden and lost to time forever, because they simply were never photographed or posted onto the internet. We can say that ""There was a nakba"" but photos of it would speak a thousand more words. I don't think there are even many photos that truly document the Palestinian genocide before the 1990s.

It's also becoming obvious who the racists are in the West. It's becoming clear that being ""pro-Israeli"" just means that you hate all Muslims. Most people are scared to say that they hate Muslims for fear of being called a racist. But if you say that you ""support Israel"", you can indirectly support genociding Muslims. Many right-wing people have realized this. And with the internet, that fact just became more obvious than ever.

I'm thankful for technology making it very hard for Israel to exist. Most lies that Israel tells are usually debunked within a few minutes of them being posted; like with the ""40 dead babies"" or that fake ""Hamas"" phone call about the Israeli bombing of a hospital. It's entertaining to see Israelis scared and constantly deleting and changing their social media posts. It's clear to me that the world doesn't support these racist ignorant people called ""Israelis"".",Israel-Garbage,t2_lbrpzilgg,0.83,8,1
849,17nb4j5,2023-11-04,AskMiddleEast,My view as a latino," 

Mexican American here. Many Latin countries care about Palestine deeply. They have always tried to stand by Palestine. Latin countries are victims of American imperialism. I don't know much about him but Carlos the Jackle was a latino who committed acts of violence in the name of Palestine.

More left leaning Latinos in America see Palestine as tied to their global struggle.

Immortal tech is a rapper from peru/NYC who raped about Palestine a decade ago. In facr you never really here pro israel stuff in hip hop.

Yes Arabs do great in Latin countries but that is not why Latin countries support palestine.

Lots of Americans of all races are protesting right now including in my small town. I want to protest because I have been to the middle east and saw with my own eyes what happens. I can't though cause my mom is really sick and I can't leave the house expect for work but if i could I'd be in DC tomorrow.

Also although many latinos are religious they are not islamicphobic. Islam never crosses their mind unless they are boot licking American latinos who pretend to be pure Spanish.

Many Latinos are in student palestine groups and even travel their though ism groups.

I love Jordan and Palestine and I saw the wall etc.

I don't really think about my race on the day to day and i love america but I hate my government. Please look at all the American people of all races standing up right now. We know we don't live in a free country we know the Neo Cons Aipac project for a new american century our are kings.

After what I saw in Jenin the wall eating farm land I will never sell my dad's land.

Also Arabs and latino not only look alike ha ha but have a simailer family values culture.

Only differnce is drugs and alchocal are mainstream and gay rights are mainstream.

I support gay rights for my country but in Jordan Palestine that's your country I don't wanna change your country just eat your food dance to your music hang out etc. I am gonna go back to Jordan at least.

In new mexico not only have people like Muhammed al kurd and miko pilo given talks but the Native Americans here love love palestine. Lots of Natives go to Palestine though ism bds groups too.

I love Arab music soooo much. I don't pretend to know if my soft life having backside should support assad but damn this is a banger.

852,179ur1y,2023-10-17,AskMiddleEast,A Personal Perspective on the Ongoing Conflict in Palestine Opinion," First of all, I'm deeply sorry for the recent loss of innocent lives in Israel. I also empathize with the Jews who suffered during World War II and any jew who has experienced injustice. No one should ever have to endure suffering because of their religion.

Today, I'm here to discuss the perspective of someone who supports the Palestinian cause. I believe it's important to present a pro-Palestinian perspective in this subreddit, as it promotes dialogue between Palestine and Israel. Given that there are limited posts about Palestine, while the focus seems predominantly on Israel, it might create an imbalance and potentially convey a skewed impression to readers. I ask you to please hear me out until the end and keep an open mind, so you can fully understand the points I'm about to make without any preconceived judgments.

I am neither Palestinian nor Israeli; I'm from Tunisia, but I have been deeply affected by the violence

of Israel. In 1985, my uncle lost his life in a terrorist attack organized by Israel, an incident that

received minimal international attention due to limited media coverage. Israel had targeted a PLO headquarters in my city, Hammam Chatt, Tunisia, resulting in collateral damage, including the loss of my uncle's life. To Israel, my uncle's life was just as insignificant as the lives of Palestinians. This was all in the pursuit of its goal, which is genocide.

What Israel has been doing for the last 75 years has contributed to actions by Hamas. Let's be clear,

not everyone from Israel is surprised by why Hamas did what it did, but none of them expected it.

Israel elected the most far-right government in its history, one that has stated that expanding settlements is its top priority. That’s left Palestinians fearful of a widespread land-grab by settlers and more violence in the occupied West Bank. Since then, we have consistently witnessed protests in Jerusalem against Muslims, along with hate chants and continuous provocations. Palestinians are prevented from entering the Mosque of Al-Aqsa, while settlers are allowed to dance in a place that holds deep religious significance for Muslims. Not to mention incidents in which Palestinians are shot by the IDF under the pretext of accidents, and those responsible often do not face the consequences of their actions. None of them are held accountable or sent to jail after unintentionally killing a Palestinian.

I am genuinely sorry about the hostages taken by Hamas. But, I don't believe Israel cares about them. I think Israel sees them as a bargaining chip for Hamas to achieve its goals. That's why Israel continued to bomb Gaza, even causing the deaths of almost 20 hostages. If Israel truly cared about its civilians, they would not resort to bombing Gaza and would instead seek negotiation. Israel's main objective appears again to be the eradication of the remaining Palestinian population. Israel is going to obliterate Gaza and they will wipe out the 2 million Gazan. They are justifying these actions under the guise of defending against what Hamas did. This seems to be their golden opportunity to address a problem that they've considered removing for a long time.

Many of you Dear readers doesnt know what Gaza is, its the world’s largest ‘open-air prison’, Gaza have been under an air, land and sea blockade By the israeli occupation leading to severe shortages of food, electricity, clothing, and medicines, preventing the people from the freedom of movement the people who live there are kicked out from their houses, forced to live everything behind to the settlers and the occupation. With 2.3 million people living on 365sq km (141sq miles) of land, the Gaza Strip is considered one of the most densely populated areas in the world. Its population density of 5,500 people per square kilometre (14,245 per square mile) lies in stark contrast to Israel’s at about 400 people per square kilometre (1,035 per square mile). An overwhelming majority of Gaza’s population is young with 65 percent being under the age of 24 and the median age for men and women being 18 years. And Yet those 2.3 millions are not considered as human beings for the israeli govermant, they consider them all terrorist, savages, or even animals and some of their ministers and government officials have made such statements clamming that Gazan's are savages and need to be elimanted. Giving Gaza is under the control of the Israeli occupation right ? that means she have every detail or informations about its residents, she have every phone numbers and knows where everybody lives, she could before bombing a residential area alert them by calling them, instead she's not doing that and making a rain of rockets to kill thousands of innocent people. When the people of Gaza started to run for their lives south, israel airstrikes them leaving 70 innocent people dead, wtf is wrong with this brutality ?

Hamas is lunching rockets that they are build in 1930 and their range is like 10km and lets say 85% of them gets intercepted by the israeli defense system, do you think its right that Israel is getting help from USA and UK just to fight Hamas ? i mean israel already have tanks, fighter jets , drones, advanced weapons , they have it all really, but its a state vs an organization. Israel has killed palestimes for the last 75 years almost 30 times the number of israeli dead how is it proportionate or justifiable to be using this machinery in a very densely civilian populated area ? Why Does the USA and UK help Israel i really dont get it.

# Why does Israel receive protection from top elite countries, while Palestinian children, women, and the elderly have no protection at all? Where do Palestinians go when they are being bombarded by the IDF?

# How many of Hamas fighter died ? that's not sure maybe less than a 100 ? How many kids and women died ?  MORE THAN1000

In the end, I want to emphasize that violence is never the solution to this conflict. Since the establishment of the country of Israel, which had its roots in violence, it has only contributed to the escalation of violence over the years. The actions of Israel are a significant factor in the existence of this conflict. Jews can coexist peacefully in Palestine, just as they did before. Muslims, Christians, and Jews lived in harmony before the advent of Zionism. As Muslims, we don't have inherent issues with Jews; we share many similarities.",BassetAHmed69,t2_gh37qo9ik,0.81,7,5

I am a young adult who was raised in a very pro-Israel environment, and I’ve been working on deprogramming myself the past couple years, but especially the past couple weeks. Tomorrow, there’s a walkout and protest at my university, inspired by the Palestine Youth Movement. Now that I fully understand Israel is the oppressor, I want to do the right thing and attend this protest, especially since many old childhood Jewish friends are still so brainwashed. However, I’m a little scared to go. NO, I don’t think anyone will hate me because I’m Jewish. But I can’t lie, I do get upset by how callously some people are talking about the murdered Israelis. (Of course, I've seen horrifying takes about murdered Palestinians too). I understand that Hamas is responding to years and years of state-sponsored horrible violence and killing, and October 7th may have even been a necessary act of resistance. But seeing people online be straight-up HAPPY on posts about Israeli deaths really does upset me.

I guess I’m wondering if you’ve been to similar protests, please share what the rhetoric is like? And also maybe let me know how the conversation changes from online to real-life? Like, I'm seeing people get called Zionists just for mourning their dead relatives in Israel. Not making a statement, or using it to justify the occupation or genocide, just mourning.

Leaping right on from the current state of affairs to a so-called united binational state seems in many ways far fetched. With so many bad blood between Israelis and Palestinians, armed groups that wouldn't be so quick to lay down their weapons, language barriers between Israelis and WB/Gaza Palestinians (most Israeli Jews don't speak Arabic and vice versa), significanct gaps in skills and education, and ignorance about each other's cultures, histories and foundational narratives, it seems almost impossible for the two populations to merge into one secular nation, or even a functioning nation.

How are people who can't understand each other's languages going to be co-workers, members of parliament, classmates?

What do you think about the idea of an interim mutually recognized partition (2SS, could also be a confederacy), under binding agreements requiring both states to take radical measures to prepare themselves for a merger in 20, 30 years?
Israel would make its younger generations as literate in Arabic as possible, get Jewish students familiar with Islam and Christianity, introduce them to Palestinian culture and encourage its entrepreneurs to invest in Palestinian companies or hire Palestinian employee, to propell the technological know-how and productivity of Palestinians forward.

Meanwhile, Palestine would embark on a similar initiative with Hebrew and Judaism, perhaps with the support of Hebrew speaking 48' Palestinian teachers/translators and funding from Israel, other Arab countries and the UN (because Israel is significantly richer). In time, the younger generations who may be more susceptible to changing dogmas and prejudices would replace the older ones, at least in politics and the workforce, and they would be equipped with the means to communicate with the other.",MijTinmol,t2_5py5yp8u,0.77,7,18

In the religious texts the sons of Issac were led into today’s Israel by Moses and over time they defeated the Palestinians and were gods favored children who kept straying away every once in a while from the right path.

Now this is where I don’t understand where did all these Israelis go? Because a lot of Israelis today are actually not Arab or native to Israel they’re settlers from all around the world after the world wars.

Did the actual natives convert into Islam and become today’s Palestinians? Or were they driven out during the various religious conquests like some claim? Are the present European Jews using the older texts to their advantage to wipe out any resistance? Or is there something basic missing in this that people fail to understand ?

""We do not seek an agreement with the \[Palestinian\] Arabs in order to secure the peace. Of course we regard peace as an essential thing.

This is everywhere in the weatbank and in gaza massive celebration, and giving of sweets. I can send DOZENS of videos via telgram but look it up. Now this subreddit is very pro palestine so a here are some counterpoints to the common cliches:

1. Why is this terror? IDF killed in jenin too.

A: Well this is an intentional attack on civillians, as opposed to IDF operations that are aimed to kill militants. And even if you consider IDF operations terrotism in your viewpoint, no one on the israeli side celebrated those.

2. Israelis probobly celebarte too.

A: never have i seen that israelis celebrate death of civillians howerver there were a few instances of individuals that celebrated the death of militiants and were criticized by media and most people.

3.those are settlers, thats why its ok.

A: Firstly if you consider the place of the first terror attack a settelment, just note it was built before the OSLO accords. Even if you do, do you really approve of killing settlers? There are a lot of beduin in Israel that settle illegaly, should they be killed and their death celebrated? 

4. Not everyone celebrates, and approves.

A: There are dozens of videos of celebration and the only one who condemned the attacks from the palestinian side was mansour abbas(palestinian israeli knesset member) .

5. This is retaliation to israeli attacks.

A: Again the israeli operations were aimed at militants, even if it was an eye for an eye situation - is that a cause for celebration? 

6. So what? they just celebrate but much worse was done to them as people.

A: I specificly debate the point of celebration of terror and what it says about society. If you want to play ""whataboutism"" it is a long game with a conflict history of 3000 years so try to stick to this specific thing.",Filomam,t2_5r7yjb5w,0.57,5,66

A guy on this subreddit influenced the post, I don't remember his u/.

1) The Jews needed a homeland because of the holocaust and what came before 

Holocaust was 1933-1945 

Balfour Declaration was in 1917 

Arabs didn't mind the refugees escaping their persecution until they started claiming their land. 

Jews have no right to establish a ""homeland"" on a land that is already inhibited by mostly non Jewish population and displace these people who are nonconsenual to israel existence just so they can feel safe in a land that isn't their's, and the only reason in them doing that is because of their ancestors who they have nothing to do with after more than 2000 years of diaspora and being fully assimilated to where they came from, you can not be a native of an area after 2000 years of not even touching the land. 

Lastly keep in mind that arabs shouldn't bleed so they don't. It's not our job to sacrifice to foreigners. 

2) arabs sold their lands 

the lands only add up to 5-7 percent, 48 percent were still palestinian property. 

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_land_purchase_in_Palestine 

i can buy a land in spain but it will still be spain territory and many other countries but no matter how much i buy it doesnt give me soverniety over it to build my own country in whatever country. palestinians who sold their land quite like the egyptian who sold land to a saudi isnt asking to be invaded or colonised by them.


3)arabs should have accepted the Partition plan and nakba was a result 

i wouldnt want to give 55 percent of my land to immigrants who came in the last few decades. the partial plan was extremely biased and supported the zionist movement without the will of the natives of the area 

jews only owned 7 percent of the land and the partition offered them 55 percent and most of these lands had palestinians on it with 70 percent majority in the places that were given to israelis so the nakba would have happened either way to secure a jewish state not a muslim majority one, it makes sense that they will want to fight to the entirety of their land regardless, Ben gurion admitted to expansionist ideals and said to his son before nakba ""we must expell the Arabs and take their lands"" 

https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://electronicintifada.net/blogs/asa-winstanley/old-will-die-and-young-will-forget-did-ben-gurion-say-it&ved=2ahUKEwj-0bz_9bf_AhWFhv0HHZ7tAncQFnoECCgQAQ&usg=AOvVaw3UOHBrwvsb6uFZ8IbcgxP5 

Nakba would have happened anyway. 

4)arabs and Jews clashes before israel 

Arabs started the clashes after balfour declaration exactly were recent immigrants jews claimed their lands and the British agreed and gave them their lands. 

5)Jews lived on the land for centuries 

There was a minority but saying they were more than that is Completely false 

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographic_history_of_Palestine_(region) 

They made 3 to 5% in very late ottoman era 

6)arabs also migrated to Palestine 

The immigration to Palestine was very insignificant, ottomans in the last hundred years encouraged migration to Palestine as it was underpopulated, regardless of that the Jews made only 7% before they did that and after it they made 5-2%, people act like Jews were a majority before it. 

A very small amount of palestinians are desendent of immigrants, A vast majority Israelis then were immigrants. 

7)why didn't arabs just make Palestine in gaza 

You want arabs to make the state of Palestine in a underdeveloped area that is less than 3% of what Palestine is supposed to be? 

There is a similar one but with West bank and gaza, again arabs shouldn't just accept getting colonized by foreigners and accept to have less than 30% person of their historical lands and the rest being given to israel with almost none of the most important parts and all being given to israel. 

___ 

A popular disgusting argument is 8 

8)Why Don't arabs just build Palestine in Jordan? They are also arabs 

You can't just kick a Brazilian out of his house and tell him he can go to Argentina, they are Hispanic too bro.


_____ 

The last but not least the most popular argument that I find no one arguing 

9)arabs expelled Jews from their lands which is why Israel is justified 

The arab persecution of Jews was a result of israel creation. Not that its right but it happened after israel or balfour declaration. 

Every arab country had its reason aswell. 

Algeria expelled anyone with french citizenship which also included the majority of algerian Jews who helped and supported the french colonialism. 

Morocco did operation yachin were they coaporated with the mossad and gave israel its Jews, alot of jews left before it to israel with the help of israel to israel to aid its military. 

Tunisia never officially expelled its Jews, they also have a Jewish minister. However some left due to the growth of anti semitism. 

The gulf never had that many Jews to start with, saudi arabia had some Jews at the south but a minister expelled them(a few hundreds) which angered king faisal and asked them to come back and they absolutely refused. 

Yemen had jews, but after a terrorist attack on a syagonese israel mossad toke almost all Jews from there in an operation. 

Most iraq Jews left in 1950-52, but people seem to throw it at the farhud(which wasn't an expulsion but racist nationalist attacks) which happened 5-7 years earlier which was caused by the Jews support to the British colonisers. Iraq also never ""officially"" expelled anyone. The reasons for them moving out can be associated with the rise of antisemitism to helping israel. 

syria also never officially expelled anyone,
most jews left to Palestine after antisemitism being on the rise before syria officially had any restrictions, all restrictions that were put later were put due to the very high immigration of Jews to Palestine to serve the Israeli military or to escape the rise in anti-Semitism or both.


For egypt It was more complex. 

Then there was some terrorist attacks due to balfour declaration, and the police started monitoring them after lavon affair 

Short summary that I wrote before 

Most egyptians Jews left before nazi germany tried to claim seuz canal because they were scared of getting genocided. However after sometimes the Egyptians authorities egyptanized egypt nationalising egypt in 1956 and its also when they nationalised the seuz canal from foreigin investors and the British and the french and kicking out anyone who came during the British era and claims land there ,greeks and even turks who mostly didn't even have citizenship getting kicked out including around 75,000 Ashkenazi jew. 

But most egyptians native Jews left before that due to nazi germany planning an attack on British egypt. 

That's the quick summary and doesn't mean there was no racism against Jews, there was infact but it wasn't the main reason for egyptian Jews leaving, there was an alot bigger threat. 

>Though Egypt had its own community of Egyptian Jews, after the Jewish expulsion from Spain more Sephardi and Karaite Jews began to migrate to Egypt, and then their numbers increased significantly with the growth of trading prospects after the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869. As a result, Jews from many territories of the Ottoman Empire as well as Italy and Greece started to settle in the main cities of Egypt, where they thrived. The Ashkenazi community, mainly confined to Cairo's Darb al-Barabira quarter, began to arrive in the aftermath of the waves of pogroms that hit Europe in the latter part of the 19th century 

>During British rule, and under King Fuad I, Egypt was friendly towards its Jewish population although between 86% and 94% of Egyptian Jews did not possess Egyptian nationality whether they had been denied it or opted not to apply. Jews played important roles in the economy, and their population climbed to nearly 80,000 as Jewish refugees settled there in response to increasing persecution in Europe. Many Jewish families, such as the Qattawi family, had extensive economic relations with non-Jews.[38]

Lebanon never expelled its Jews, most jews left after 1967 due to the civil unrest and economical finanicial reasons. 

Jordan never had that many Jews except in West bank, After the Six-Day War in 1967, Jordan lost control of the West Bank to Israel. As a result, the Jewish population in Jordan diminished significantly, as most Jews living in the West Bank either relocated to Israel or were displaced during the war.

First, they think that they're the ""chosen people"". Most religion has a god who thinks that their followers are the best and are the ""chosen people"". But Zionist tend to be more extreme and they think they're better than everyone else. Zionists also sit together at work for lunch, and they don't interact with others.   


They think because they're ""chosen people"", they deserve a homeland. Yet when you say otherwise, they use propaganda words like ""anti-semetic"" and ""racist"". And if you support a homeland for other people, like Palestinians or Germans or white people, they'll scream ""you're racist, HATE HATE!!!!"". So it's not racist for Jews to get their own country, but racist for other groups of people like Palestinians or white people?   


Zionists also want ""diversity"" in Europe and America, but then when you talk about diversity in Israel, they scream ""HATE HATE HATE!!!! Israel is for the Jews only!!!"". So only Jews can have an ethno-state and nobody else?

Don't even say ""Both Palestine and Israel has a right to exist."" It's just Israeli propaganda, so that when they lose a war in the future, they'll have to give some land to Palestine. But all Israelis want Palestine to be completely destroyed and annexed. If you support Palestine, you should support the full decolonization of the whole of Israel.

In conclusion, nobody should be listening to or trying to appease Zionists. Don't participate in those ""Iarael-Palestine Friendship"" narratives.

This is a catastrophic shortsighted blunder by Hamas, not only are they descending upon Israelis like ISIS style Jihadis, the whole world will see the obvious terror outfit this organization is.

886,172pypc,2023-10-08,IsraelPalestine,Pay attention to Pro Palestinian supporters,"Today was the worst massacre of Jews since WW2.

&#x200B;

Today we saw what ""Free Palestine"" and ""From the River to the Sea"" really means.

&#x200B;

* Palestinians murdered, kidnapped, and raped innocent Jews on a holiday, 50 years to the date of the Yom Kippur War.
* Palestinians murdered 400 Jews and counting.
* Palestinians  raped, mutilated and paraded with the naked body of a Jewish woman that they murdered as if she was a trophy.
* Palestinians anally raped a teenage Jewish girl and kidnapped her to Gaza.
* Palestinians murdered seniors who were merely sitting at a bus stop.
* Palestinians kidnapped children who they will likely torture and murder.
* Palestinians are beheaded Jewish soldiers in the streets.
* Palestinians are stopped vehicles and slit the throats of the people in them.
* Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank are celebrating the massacre of Jews today.
* Palestinians around the world, such as in New York, London and Berlin, are celebrating the massacre of Jews today.
* Some of the images and videos we are seeing of Palestinians are similar to the works of other jihadis such as IS, Al Qaeda and the Taliban.

&#x200B;

If your takeaway from the massacre of 300 Jews is that the world has ignored the issue of a Palestinian state or some whataboutism, you are NOT a human rights advocate - YOU ARE AN ANTISEMITIC BIGOT. There is no justification for murder of innocent Jewish civilians. Land is not an excuse to pillage, rape, kidnap and murder,  especially when it wasn't their land to claim.

&#x200B;

The Palestinian cause has remained unevolved for 100 years and is an Antisemitic death cult, calling for the genocide of Jews. The irony is that Palestinian supporters scream cease-fire when Israel has to address the terrorism in Gaza but they will never condemn the rape, kidnapping and murder of innocent Jews which led to it.

&#x200B;

The 2 state solution is dead. The 1 state solution is dead.  You can thank Hamas, who was willfully elected by an overwhelming majority of Palestinians. Palestinians and their supporters have proved that they are not legitimate peace partners and at any opportunity, if they are not excusing the murder of innocent Jews, they are celebrating and/or partaking in it.

2000: Israel offers Yasser Arafat recognition of a Palestinian state in all of Gaza and 94% of the West Bank with East Jerusalem as its Capital. Arafat rejects it and launches the Second Intifada.  
2005: Israel pulls out of the Gaza Strip, dismantles all its settlements, and forces Jews to leave their homes. Palestinians respond by electing Hamas who turn it into a terror state.  
2008: Israel offers Mahmoud Abbas once again recognition of a Palestinian state in all of Gaza and 94% of the West Bank with East Jerusalem as its Capital and even offered to dismantle all their settlements. And once again, the Palestinians reject it.  
2010-2021: Hamas launches periodic rocket attacks against the state of Israel and builds terror tunnels in order to kidnap and murder Jews while using the people of Gaza as human shields against the IDF.  
2023: Hamas commits the worst act of mass murder against Jews since the Holocaust.

And yet if I wasn’t israeli and was completely neutral I would definitely think the same and side with Palestine. I stand with israel for selfish reasons, I want to be safe, I want my family friends and loved ones to be safe, this has always been my home. When I see ppl online calling for me to die, or “go back to Europe”, I’m not sure what they want me to do.

I don’t want Gaza to get bombed. I don’t think the countless civilian deaths help us whatsoever. Even expressing that opinion in Israel is a hot take. A lot of my friends who were leftists are calling for destruction of Gaza since 10/7.

Doing “hasbara” online feels pointless since the majority is pro Palestine, and for some of their points I don’t have answers. I’m convinced IDF has done evil things. But when I see them justifying the events of 10/7, I’m furious. The way they somehow justify the party massacre, when it could’ve been me getting slaughtered.",ilikepeanuts4,t2_o71jsj9g,0.87,558,1479

895,175eput,2023-10-11,IsraelPalestine,Young American Jew Feeling Alienated,"Not sure if this is the best subreddit for this but I just want to share my thoughts the past few days in an honest way and start conversation among young Jews. I do not feel comfortable sharing my thoughts with any of my Jewish friends and family. I wanted to post this in the r/Judaism thread but they prohibit Israel/Palestine content so this seems like the next best place. 

I’ll try to be as brief as possible, so some nuance may be lost for the sake of brevity. I feel alienated by the American Jewish community for my thoughts on the recent violence in Israel/Palestine. These are my thoughts: 1) I condemn Hamas’ war crimes against Israelis. 2) I condemn the Israeli government’s war crimes against Palestinians. 3) I mourn for the innocent lives lost of all nationalities in the past days. I am absolutely flabbergasted that saying these 3 things simultaneously is considered controversial— to me all of these things should be patently obvious and non-controversial. Yet if I shared these views on social media, my Jewish friends and family would be furious at me for mentioning Israeli and Hamas war crimes in the same breath and call me a self-hating Jew who believes Israelis deserved to die. They would attack me for mentioning both Israeli and Palestinian victims, because it implies that Israel is equally as bad as Hamas. 

Acknowledging the historical impacts of the West Bank occupation and Gaza siege is not equivalent to saying that “Israeli victims deserved to die”. Multiple things can be true at once: Hamas is directly responsible for its war crimes AND anti-Palestinian Israeli policies over the past decades created a powder keg ready to erupt in Gaza. I believe it’s important to recognize the full context of the violence, especially when thinking about how further violence can be prevented in the future. I’ve seen several Israeli commentators state this same sentiment in recent articles.

Basically I feel like a crazy person for simply mourning for both Israelis and Palestinians and acknowledging basic historical realities. I know I’ll probably get hate comments here as well because that’s how it goes. But please just know that I come from a place of good faith— I am genuinely devastated by the recent deaths of civilians and only wish that I could honestly discuss where to go from here with fellow Jews without being verbally attacked.

Do the people who post this phrase everywhere realize they’re indirectly blaming Israel for this entire conflict? Did they forget the war started because Hamas murdered 1200 civilians? 

The mostly liberal view that if we all just loved each other more everything would be fine is so naive. They do not understand that Hamas does not exist because people in Gaza are oppressed, it exists because since it’s inception almost every country in the region has tried to destroy Israel. Terrorism has nothing to do with poverty or oppression. Osama bin laden was very wealthy. Most of the leaders of Hamas are also very wealthy. 

The majority of people who post that stupid slogan are virtue signalling fools with no understanding of the conflict. If you do not defeat Hamas more Jews will die. They will exert revenge on Israel for this attack. You cannot simply show the people in Gaza more compassion and expect Hamas to give up. It’s such a bad argument. 

Israel should respect the human rights of people in Gaza but they need to defeat Hamas if they want to survive as a nation. As far as I can tell the only way to do this is by invading the territory. Imagine how much longer ww2 would have lasted if the allies did not invade Germany. None of the people calling for peace right now have any practical solutions.",OkBuyer1271,t2_7bw4mdfp,0.72,429,1752

No - because we decided to build a wonderful country and focus on the good and not like our neighbors just keep crying that they want their country back even though in practice there was almost nothing here.

And one last thing - pay attention to all the Arab countries I mentioned or even to Gaza, pay attention to the standard of living there that does not come close to Israel and it is not for nothing, the regimes there are dark and primitive and if a day comes and Israel falls and Palestine rises here in its place, we all probably understand that it will be another counry sponsored by terrorism And darkness and not the amazing advance and high-tech nation that Israel built.",randomuser390,t2_5zoqdxwl,0.79,389,1021
899,17mc9t1,2023-11-02,IsraelPalestine,I saw a video of a Palestinian Woman in Gaza Cursing at Hamas,"I’m a Palestinian American that is Anti-Hamas. Let me be clear I am absolutely SICK to my stomach about what Hamas have done to the Israelis. But that aside I wanna once again talk about Hamas’s impact on the Palestinians. I’ve said this before and I’ll say it again: we don’t know how many people in Gaza ACTUALLY support Hamas because they’re documented to execute critics and political rivals. I wish video posts were allowed here because I saw a video of a mother in Gaza who lost her children calling Hamas dogs and three men were holding her that appeared to be her family members. They quickly put their hands on her mouth and told her to be quiet and BBC had to blur her face. They didn’t blur anyone else’s faces. You wanna know why? Because if Hamas were to find out who she was they’d BRUTALLY torture and execute her. And that’s what’s so frustrating about the worldwide Hamas support. Even if you support Palestinians, let me be ABSOLUTELY AND ABUNDANTLY CLEAR: HAMAS COULD CARE LESS ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS TO THEIR OWN CIVILIANS. Hamas officials have just admitted they don’t believe Gazan civilians are their responsibility and so they built shelters for their COWARDLY selves but not their people AND they added fuel to the fire in the midsts of THEIR PEOPLE BEING KILLED by stating that they’ll keep repeating October 7th until “israel is destroyed” and that everything they do is “justified”. I speak Arabic so I can confirm the translations were accurate. Hamas have a selfish goal of Islamic world domination in which they will be the leaders. Destruction of Israel is only step one for them. Tone deaf and brainwashed Palestinians and their supporters outside Gaza champion and make excuses for Hamas from their places of privilege without having any regard for how AWFUL Hamas have been for their own people.Especially when non Palestinians try to defend Hamas. As a Palestinian this all makes me ANGRY! Hamas did these attacks knowing Israel would strike back with great force and they prepared themselves for it but not the “people they’re fighting for”. I understand why Israel want to eradicate Hamas although I wish they were more calculated because it’s simply wrong to kill 400 Palestinian civilians just to target one Hamas member (the refugee camp). I feel like we should all agree on that. I want Hamas gone and I know they use their people as human shields but Israel could do more to minimize civilian casualties. In any case Hamas need to be eradicated for the sake of ALL of humanity, Israelis, Jews, Palestinians, and the world. 

Edit: Let me also add they used all the money and resources donated to their people to build weapons and live in mansions, fly private jets, eat good, and rent expensive hotels outside of Palestine while their people starve. They are the definition of selfish.

Let me also clarify, that I don’t agree with the right wing position on this subject either (basically just the opposite of this, supporting Israel and downplaying their government’s atrocities). But, as a member of multiple leftist communities on this site, I am constantly seeing people fully supporting Palestine with the justification that what Hamas does isn’t as bad as what Israel does. I can agree with the justification to an extent, since Israel is just as guilty as Hamas when it comes to oppression and violence, but what I don’t understand is everyone chanting “Free Palestine” and showing no remorse for the Israeli people that were harmed. About the phrase “Free Palestine”: on a surface level, this phrase is perfectly fine. However, I like to compare this phrase to the phrase “All Lives Matter”. On a surface level, there’s nothing wrong with it, but it’s the stigma and history behind it that makes it offensive to say. With all lives matter, it’s due to it being against the blm movement, and with free Palestine, especially since these horrific events occurred, it’s due to the phrase subtly implying that the actions of Hamas are justifiable, and even more so, completely disregarding the suffering of those in Israel. Now, I really want to give the left the benefit of the doubt that they don’t support Hamas, but it’s starting to get really difficult, with people implying that their actions are for a greater cause. I’m not necessarily saying that they support Hamas, but I really am starting to see a pattern of them never bringing up the horrible things Hamas has done and only hating on Israel; same with the right, they only talk about how horrible Hamas is with no regards to the atrocities of the Israeli government. I’m not saying that it’s a 50/50 necessarily, but neither side is justified in the slightest, and all our support should be aimed towards the innocent people of both sides rather than the oppressors of either side.

My personal view:

- Israel has a right to exist. They DO exist. They are going nowhere. Until Palestinian leadership acknowledge this fact, no meaningful solution can found

- Hamas is a terror organisation who have shown they are war criminals and incapable of peace. There is no justification for their actions. 

- I believe that moderate Palestinians exist who would be willing to acknowledge Israel, as the PLO/PA have done in the past. Such leaders are the only possible partners in peace

- I hate Bibi intensely. He must take serious blame for weakening Israel’s democracy, inflaming tensions in Israel and in Palestine, and now, for leading Israel into what will be a long and costly war, all because he puts his own interests over the nation’s interest. I think he could prolong this war to keep himself out of jail for fraud

- Despite this, I think his policy of building relations across the Arab world was smart and must continue. If your enemy really don’t like it, you must be on to something

- Palestine has a right to exist. They DO exist, like Israel. The post-1967 War occupation of WB & Gaza was a massive mistake that should be reversed asap. Of course Gaza hasnt been occupied for 18 years and we saw how that went. And as above, Hamas must go and moderate leaders be found before any solution can occur. 

- The Free Palestine movement is full of lies and propaganda, including false claims of apartheid, genocide and war crimes. Many people who support them in western countries do so from a noble desire to help oppressed people and innocent victims, but unfortunately they also believe the many many lies (the recent hospital explosion is a good example) and the frankly anti-semitic tropes.

But then none of those people open their mouths when innocent people were dying in Afghanistan and in iraq, no one had hashtag free Iraq in their bio

Then the war on Ukraine happened and as an Arab, people around me in my society and on Facebook we're celebrating screaming that ""it's sinners killing sinners let God take them all""

What happened to standing with the innocent? 

So it appears that Arabs/ Muslims don't care about the innocent people in Palestine they just care about the land itself because it has religious meaning to them (it is literally connected to the judgment Day in islam, the day Palestine is free is the day of judgment for Muslims)

And then the hair that broke the donkey's back is the words ""free Palestine"" turned into an anti-semitic dog whistle.

I be scrolling randomly on tiktok or Facebook and I come upon videos that either talk about Jews/ the Holocaust, or from a Jewish creator that is not related to the conflict between Palestine and Israel in any way shape or form and I see some of the comments read free Palestine.

What does a Jewish creator that lives in America has to do with free palestine?

I'm getting fed up with people hiding behind the altruistic screams of free Palestine, free the innocent, to hide their internal racism and anti-semitism

""You will not find a people who believe in God and the Last Day being friendly with those who oppose God and His Messenger, even if they were their fathers, sons, or brothers. Or their clan"" [Al-Mujadila 22]

And here is what the Quran says about those that appose Islam, and in this context not believing in the Islamic god counts as opposing

""The punishment for those who wage war against God and His Messenger and strive upon earth to spread corruption is only that they be killed, or be crucified, or have their hands and feet cut off, or banished from the land.

912,17l29ll,2023-11-01,IsraelPalestine,Confessions of a Broken Leftist,"  
  
First, I want to say that I am an American Democrat and an Israeli leftist.  I was active in Peace Now and Meretz.  I have been in countless political debates over 30 years, and I have always stood up for the rights of Palestinians. I am well aware of the inequity in Israel, from the funding of schools to the separate roads, to the roadblocks, to settlements, and so on.  Both Palestinians and Israelis have done a lot to undermine good faith over the years- each side doing their own fair share of subversion- from Israeli continuing settlements to Palestinians blowing up busses- I could go on.  
  
But in this last round of violence, I am shocked to my core.    
  
Israel withdrew from Gaza- literally pulling and dragging the Israelis living there from their home- in order to end its occupation of Gaza.  And Israel built the iron dome to protect its citizens from rocket attacks, basically allowing them to not respond to every provocation.    
  
And Gaza got both freedom and billions of dollars of aid. Were there problems? Yes- I'm not here to completely whitewash the situation.  But I also won't say that Gaza was an “Open air prison.”  The people of Gaza had cars and a beach, sweet shops and barbers, beautiful homes and malls.  Being confined to 140 square miles does not make a prison.  
  
But over the past 16 years, Hamas has never used its money or power to build infrastructure, improve schools, or create parks.  They spend every dollar and every ounce of energy preparing for war.  They built hundreds of miles of tunnels every convenience and armed themselves with guns, rockets, night vision, and anti-tank weapons. And they quietly waited.  
  
They waited until October 7th and then attacked with all their evil fury.  They burned babies in the oven if front of their parents.  They shot children in front of their siblings.  They committed every kind of barbaric atrocity on civilians, the elderly, teenagers, small children, and babies.  
  
And before Israel could even count the number killed, there were crowds chanting in the streets “700!”  Ghouls taking glee in our murder, laughing at our pain and humiliation.  These same people now crying for a ceasefire.  
  
Why? Was it because we were “colonizers?”   Doesn’t every American live on land that was stolen from Native Americans, people that went through a REAL genocide?    
  
And how can Jews be colonizers of their original homeland?  I would say that we are a people who have been re-indginized to our native land.  And for those who would argue, “Yes, there you lost that land 2000 years ago to the Romans, there are other people living here now- get over it!” I would simply argue that under that logic- “fine you lost your land to the Jews, get over it.”  Either way, Israel is now the homeland of the Jews and we aren’t going anywhere.  
  
But what I know now is that no logic will ever reach Hamas and its supporters.  To them, the land of Palestine is Muslim land forever. They will never accept a Jewish presence in Israel. Never.  They may wait, but they will still be preparing to fight an endless battle.  
  
See, this is what I didn’t get before. I was coming at this problem as an American. What I mean is that we have certain values imprinted on our personalities.  As a Democrat or a Republican if they believe that, “people are born with certain inalienable rights, and among those rights are “life liberty, and the pursuit of happiness” they will both say yes. They could disagree on every single issue, but they would agree on that.    
  
Most European countries share these enlightenment values. The French motto is “Liberty, Equality and Fraternity.” Germany's motto is “Unity, Justice, and Freedom.”  We all share certain Western values, shaped by the Enlightenment.  
  
But these aren’t Hamas’s values. Not at all.  Look at this from Article 8  of the Hamas Charter.  It reiterates the Muslim Brotherhood's slogan of ""Allah is its goal, the Prophet is the model, the Qur'an its constitution, jihad its path, and death for the sake of Allah is the loftiest of its wishes.""  
  
Hamas and all radial Islam come from a place that is totally alien to us. Their goal is holy war.  They hope their children die as martyrs.   
  
So while I thought dealing with things like roadblocks and water rights would solve our problems and we could get along in peace, what I realize now is that there is no path to peace with someone whose dream is to kill you or die trying.  Literally.  
  
Meanwhile, Israel has to defend itself against the worst kind of medieval barbarism and is expected to do so with the utmost care and responsibility for every civilian.  Assad killed over 200,000 people in the Syrian Civil War? Meh, Arab on Arab crime, is not our business.  But Israel uses white phosphorous…. WAR CRIME!!!  It's not about Arab lives that drive many of you so crazy- it's that the JEWS did it some people can't stand.  
  
But what really hurts the most I think, is that Hamas fucked us in a primal way. Israel MUST keep up its defensive doctrine.  It MUST retaliate and remove its enemies, or as we know, they will be back soon.  But Hamas also took 240 hostages.  And Israel would do anything to save its citizens.  It released 1,000 prisoners to get Gilad Shalit back.  Because in Judaism, we believe in LIFE, not death. There is no garden of virgins waiting for us to die at the hands of the enemy.  
  
But we have to make a horrible choice- whether Israel says it out loud or not- retaliate and remove Hamas and sacrifice our hostages, or put down our weapons and beg for them back, allowing the savages that butcher our children to revel in victory.   
  
Of course, we have to fight or we will never be safe.  But the wound this causes on our deeply held values will never heal.  And the process is eating all of our souls and driving us insane.  So Hamas has already won in that way.  
  
All my life, I have had empathy for Palestinians. There have been wars where I have demanded a ceasefire.  There have been times I have cried for Palestinian pain—no more.  
  
Perhaps the worst wound of this war is that I can no longer have empathy for the people of Gaza.  I don’t have the heart or the emotional space to grieve for our families, our children, our kidnapped hostages- and feel pain for the poor innocent Palestinian child.  That died in me, and for that I blame Hamas.    
  
Where a huge crater opened up in the earth after a bombing today, I shrugged.  This is war.  This is what Hamas wanted.  They begged for us to enter Gaza with our full rage.  People are going to die.  You don’t like it now?  Too fucking bad. Could have made a different decision on October 6th.  Honestly, why are people complaining about Israel’s response?  We are just doing exactly what Hamas asked us to do!  
  
To those who support us in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the United States, everywhere- thank you for your support.  It means the world to us.  
  
To those of you with your intersectionality, your colonial narrative, your faux intellectual liberalism, your both side-ism- wake up and take a good look at the world. You are next.  “Gay for Hamas?”  You could be having a great time in Israel but you choose to be lynched or thrown off a building. Dumb assess.  
  
For those of you who are just good old-fashioned antisemites, thank you for your honesty. At least you are better than the phony bitches who hide their antisemitism behind pretend ethics. Nevertheless, you are vile, despicable, and evil.  I hope you don’t wake up in the morning.  
  
Just understand this, all of you.  We Jews are lovers of peace and life.  We also have enlightenment values.  We just want our tiny ancient homeland to grow fruits and vegetables, have a TV, a car, and a couch.  We want to sing and dance.  We don’t think you need to be Jewish to be a good person. We aren’t trying to trick you, own you, manipulate you, take your land… nothing. We want to be left alone to live in dignity as a people deserving a place in this world.  
  
But if you don’t deserve a home, don’t deserve respect, don’t deserve dignity… if you cheer for our murder, or criticize us for defending our homeland- you need to know that we will fight for our survival, and we won't apologize for it.  
  
When Hamas has been eradicated, I look forward to working towards peace with our arab neighbors- all of them.  I still dream of peace. But not until Hamas is destroyed to the man, no matter what the cost.  This is what Hamas has done to me.

It pisses me off to see people being so naive.

According to polls more than 50% of Palestinians in Gaza and other Israel regions support Hamas:

That's and extremely large number. If there was a Palestinian state, you know who would the leader be tomorrow.

You can see that Hamas members are bringing hostages to the city and many Palestinians, including those teenagers which you always blame Israel for arresting them,  are surrounding the truck and filming these disgusting scenes. Come on man, this is 2023. You can't pretend to want your own land while engage in barbaric actions such as this. Those children and men are either brainwashed or actually believe in these acts of evil.

I am Iranian and know well that the regime in Iran used CHILDREN to intimate/attack protesters. Hamas and Palestinians seems to be the same. They use children as tools. This is the ugly side of war. If the next protests in Iran arises and 16 year old kids start shooting people, you can't expect Iranians to not defend themselves.  

What I haven't seen though is Israeli soldiers arresting, kidnapping, raping women and children and executing after while Israeli citizens and children watching them. That just proves the difference between the two sides of war.

914,173dhf6,2023-10-08,IsraelPalestine,Your terrorism is showing,"First, as someone who has lived and studied in both Israel and Palestine (and has friends and family in both) it is abhorrent to see social media warriors make blanket statements about an incredibly nuanced conflict. I believe that unless you have spent considerable time in this region, you do not have an informed opinion and you should not be contributing to these discussions. In a situation where religion, history, culture, and terrorism are all huge factors, these discussions can not be taken lightly. You are contributing to an already lethal situation by spouting your uninformed Instagram opinions. 

Second, Hamas ≠ Palestine and Palestine ≠ Hamas. Hamas is a terrorist organization. Hamas’s primary goal is the eradication of all Jews on this planet (starting with the Jewish state). By saying you are in support of the Hamas terrorist attack, you are supporting terrorism—not Palestine. 

Third, saying you are not anti-Jewish but are anti-Israel is a terrifyingly ignorant statement to make. Every religion on this planet has a home base in which they can freely and safely practice their religion. Muslims have Mecca. Christians have the Vatican City. The Jews lacked even the idea of a state until the British Balfour declaration of 1917. Israel is the Jewish state. Whether you agree with that or support it is another story, but that is a fact. Saying you are anti-Israel has the same meaning as being an antisemite. 

Fourth, you can be pro-Palestine and pro-Israel. Supporting one does not mean you denounce the other. 

I genuinely believe education and lived experiences are key in this battle. Obviously don’t hop on a flight right now, but when you can, spend time in both areas then feel free to spew any opinion you resonate with.

920,179qi65,2023-10-17,IsraelPalestine,Why are Israelis constantly called “European Jews” when only ~30% of Israel is Ashkenazi?,"Years ago, I crossed paths with a lot of pro-Palestine people through some student work at my university and was constantly hearing “European settlers” and “people from Brooklyn coming to Palestine” being thrown around. I had not been to Israel yet but as most of my Israeli friends were white-passing, I kind of took it for facts that many Israelis had family roots in Eastern Europe before coming to the area. Why this is an argument for anything at all is another question but the myth of Israel being a “white country” was sort of ingrained in me in no small part by pro-Palestine people themselves. It was a trip to Israel later that I bothered to look up demographics of Israel and learned that only 30% are Ashkenazi (European Jews) while the vast majority are also indigenous to the Middle East not in the 3,000 years ago kind of way but in the “Jewish grandma was forced out of Syria/Lebanon/Yemen” kind of way.

So what argument could there possibly be that Israelis are really “Europeans” who colonized Palestine? Is it just a convenient way to delegitimize Israel? At the most generous interpretation, this view is based on a misconception because many famous Israelis and much of Israel’s elite are Ashkenazi (similar to how white privilege favors some for advancement in the US but is in no way indicative of demographics).

924,1779t7g,2023-10-13,IsraelPalestine,I’m Going to War for Israel. Palestinians Are Not My Enemy,"By Nir Avishai Cohen

I was in Austin, Texas, for work on Saturday when I received a call from my commander in the Israel Defense Forces to return to Israel and head to the front line. I didn’t hesitate. I knew that the citizens of my country were in real danger. My duty first and foremost is to join the fight against those who unleashed a massacre on my people. I boarded the first flight I found out of Austin to head home to join the I.D.F. reserves, where I serve as a brigade operations command officer.

During my long flight to Israel, my mind couldn’t rest. I was trying to write down my feelings and thoughts about everything happening — and everything that’s about to happen — in my beloved country.

Little by little, the dimensions of the horrors of the most brutal attack that Israelis have experienced since the establishment of the state were being revealed. Hundreds of Hamas terrorists slaughtered more than 1,200 people, including women, children and older people. About 150 citizens and soldiers have been taken captive. There’s nothing in the world that can justify the murder of hundreds of innocent people.

But I’d like to say one thing clearly, before I go to battle: There’s no such thing as “unavoidable.” This war could have been avoided, and no one did enough to prevent it. Israel did not do enough to make peace; we just conquered the Palestinian territories in the West Bank, expanded the illegal settlements and imposed a long-term siege on the Gaza Strip.

For 56 years Israel has been subjecting Palestinians to oppressive military rule. In my book “Love Israel, Support Palestine,” I wrote: “Israeli society has to ask itself very important questions about where and why the blood of its sons and daughters was spilled. A Messianic religious minority has dragged us into a muddy swamp, and we are following them as if it were the piper from Hamelin.” When I wrote these words last year, I didn’t realize how deep in the mud we were, and how much more blood could be shed in so little time.

I am now going to defend my country against enemies who want to kill my people. Our enemies are the deadly terrorist organizations that are being controlled by Islamic extremists.

Palestinians aren’t the enemy. The millions of Palestinians who live right here next to us, between the Mediterranean Sea and Jordan, are not our enemy. Just like the majority of Israelis want to live a calm, peaceful and dignified life, so do Palestinians. Israelis and Palestinians alike have been in the grip of a religious minority for decades. On both sides, the intractable positions of a small group have dragged us into violence. It doesn’t matter who is more cruel or more ruthless. The ideologies of both have fueled this conflict, leading to the deaths of too many innocent civilians.

As a major in the reserves, it is important to me to make it clear that in this already unstoppable new war, we cannot allow the massacre of innocent Israelis to result in the massacre of innocent Palestinians. Israel must remember that there are more than two million people living in the Gaza Strip. The vast majority of them are innocent. Israel must do everything in its power to avoid killing innocent people and to focus on destroying the militant army of Hamas.

This war, like others before it, will end sooner or later. I am not sure I will come back from it alive, but I do know that a minute after the war is over, both Israelis and Palestinians will have to reckon with the leaders who led them to this moment. We must wake up and not let the extremists rule. Palestinians and Israelis must denounce the extremists who are driven by religious fanaticism. The Israelis will have to oust National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and their far-right circle from power, and the Palestinians will have to oust the leadership of Hamas.

I try to look for shreds of hope. The Yom Kippur War, the most difficult war that Israel had known until this week, started by surprise in 1973. After a peace agreement between Israel and Egypt was finally signed in 1979, the border with Egypt — one that was once the site of the dead and wounded — became a border of peace.

Israelis must realize that there is no greater security asset than peace. The strongest army cannot protect the country the way peace does. This current war proves it once again. Israel has followed the path of war for too long.

At the end, after all of the dead Israelis and Palestinians are buried, after we have finished washing away the rivers of blood, the people who share a home in this land will have to understand that there is no other choice but to follow the path of peace. That is where true victory lies.

927,17bg6f1,2023-10-19,IsraelPalestine,I’m so sick of people saying that Hamas doesn’t represent Palestine.,"If that’s the case, explain why there are crowds of people in Gaza cheering them on as they parade an innocent civilian through the streets of Gaza.

Yes, they don’t represent ALL of Gaza, but neither does the IDF and hardline Israeli government represent ALL of Israel.

It’s really stupid at this point. Most people from these two sides hate each other and would absolutely try to get rid of the other side if it’s a viable option.

Moreover, I’m sick of muslims acquaintances chewing me out for saying that “I don’t want to take a side because there’s a lot of propaganda and that this situation is very nuanced, therefore it would be irresponsible to take one side or the other.” Their reply would be that “Your silence and ignorance is allowing the genocide of Palestinians yada yada yada.” Another person posted Joe Biden’s quote saying something that from the data he has seen, Israel wasn’t responsible for the hospital blast. Saying that “Maybe Biden should get new eyes.” I replied to them saying that although inconclusive, it’s more than likely that it was a Hamas rocket that accidentally fell. As you would expect they absolutely berated me for falling for “Western Propaganda” when I cited BBC and Reuters as well as the Twitter thread from the geolocators showing convincing argument that it’s most likely self-inflicted(I know it sounds unreliable af, but it’s actually pretty solid). When I asked for their source, they sent something from… Al Jazeera. Of course, complete with graphic posts of the people of Gaza suffering from a muslim insta account.

Anyways, I’d actually like to know more about what Israel has done to Palestinians that made muslims hate them so much, so I’d appreciate resources from reliable sources.

Also, just for the record, I still don’t want to take sides and that while I understand Israel’s retaliation, I absolutely don’t think that they should stop electricity, food, and water from entering Gaza as it is inhumane.

Edit : 

TLDR and to clarify what I meant : Hamas doesn’t represent ALL Palestinians, but they do represent SOME and I’m tired of people painting ALL Palestinians as angels by saying Hamas doesn’t represent them.

938,16gp5bu,2023-09-12,IsraelPalestine,Why are pro Palestinian Americans so aggressive,"Yesterday I wore a shirt to school that said “Am Israel High” with a pic of snoop dog wearing a Star of David. Cute shirt. An Egyptian girl on campus literally snarled and asked me why I’m wearing an Israel shirt. She started mocking me and asking me what I’m trying to say. I told her it was an unproductive argument I wasn’t willing to engage in. I continually insisted I was not interested. She stood there looking like an idiot and started following me before finally walking away and saying, “Okay, Palestine shirt.” 

I’m an Ethiopian Jew and I’ve had this experience quite a few times with American arab immigrants. With no intention of approaching the situation diplomatically, they become nasty and angry. An old friend of mine told me I had blood on my hands after finding out I was going to Israel for vacation. Well what about your mother who’s tax dollars fund Israeli settlements. Is that how you change someone’s mind? It’s this exact behavior that keeps Israel strong. If you really believe in a free Palestine, you are by all means entitled to your own way of thought, but what are you actually doing to secure the future of a free Palestine if that’s what you want? 

I have no interest in entertaining this idea of a corrupt Israel, the whole world is corrupt, the United States even more corrupt than Israel. That’s why Americans getting aggressive about Israel is laughable to me. I don’t say this as a justification for the brutalization of Palestinians. But as a Jew, I’m willing to compromise my morals for the sake of Israel. I have spent a considerable amount of time there and I truly feel at home there.

It's a call for the Israeli Occupation of the region to end. But probe a bit further, and very obvious issues start to arise.

When most people speak of Palestine, they envision a democracy, a country where they can be safe in, where they can have the same opportunities to thrive as others, a country that's theirs. Yet, they don't seem to quite grasp the situation - what will actually happen if Israel leaves. They have sunken so deeply into this idealistic version of what they view as their home they have become blind to who controls it. Because if Israel leaves, a democracy that's a safe haven to all Palestinians will not be what rises. 

Palestinians tend to forget that the people who will take charge are not a bunch of peace loving hippies, but people who will kill indiscriminately to reach their goal of an Islamic state. They are not fighting for your freedom, but for their ideology, an ideology most will agree is not the reality most want to live in. 

The organizations that the Palestinians often praise, that they defend, are a hurdle just as large, if not larger, than the Israeli occupation of the territory that will need to be overcome for what they truly want Palestine to be to be realized.

How do Palestinians think Arabs even came to live in that area? It was through war and colonization! the Arab Palestinians are not the descendants of the philistines however the Israelis are the decents of the Hebrew people living there hundreds of years ago. 


As being Persian Iranian another nation the Arabs attempted to colonize I feel deeply about this topic.

942,15ojk15,2023-08-11,IsraelPalestine,Why I support Israel after previously having extremist views against it,"Hi all, I’ve been wanting to share my story for a while on why I support Israel after hating its very existence for so many years. 

So I’m going to start off by saying I’m part Slavic and part Middle Eastern (most of that being Arab and Amazigh) among other things. I’d also like to point out I have Sephardic Jewish ancestors but I wasn’t raised Jewish and didn’t know this until recently. I’ve always supported Palestine in my younger years simply because a Palestinian married into my family but through my teen years I hated Israel and even used the Israeli flag as a doormat for my room. I would post online one of the many alleged human rights violations to try to prove my side and would not listen to any other opinion. 

However, the more I would learn about the conflict the less sympathy I would have for Palestine. Starting in 1936, some Palestinian Arabs fired the very first shot during the Arab Revolt and in the 40’s, Mufti Amin Al-Husseini befriended Adolf Hitler and even partially contributed to the idea of The Holocaust. Because of tensions, the UN split the land and made Jerusalem an International Zone. Israel accepted the plan and declared independence as the only Jewish state and the very next day, Palestinians along with the Arab League tried to destroy Israel and lost. They tried again and again to destroy Israel and they lost. 

Now a days, they label Israel as a Colonial and Apartheid state and cry bloody murder online. The simply fact is, Jews aren’t Khazars but rather they are native to that land and it’s been proven by genetic studies such as ones by the NIH, Harvard University, 23andme and Ancestry DNA yet Palestinians along with Bigots and many Muslims continue to dehumanize Jews with this myth. Another reason I stopped supporting them is because of the lies they tell such as forced evictions and killings. Silwan is a good example, Silwan was Jewish owned until 1948 and it’s believed to be where King Solomon’s garden was. In the 80’s or 90’s Palestinians built illegal houses on the land even though photos show no one living there and it was a National Park yet they lie and cry Apartheid on social media. Most evictions are in East Jerusalem and happen because a Jew buys the house or the tenants don’t pay rent. Another one is killings such as in the Jenin operation about a month ago. The Media along with Palestinians alleged Israel murdered innocent children yet failed to show the photos of them in terrorist uniforms with weapons but rather shows them in normal clothes smiling to gain sympathy. Other allegations are from well fillings too but fail to mention they are illegal under Palestinian and Israeli law and get filled because they are in areas such as Nablus that have water shortage and such wells are dangerous to wildlife. Gaza is another example of lying where they claim it’s a prison yet videos like [this](https://youtu.be/wCuOHr3jMMk) show Gaza is rather nice and sure Israel will destroy a building but what they don’t tell you is that Israel only does so to target a terrorist and they actually warn before a strike but it’s Hamas that tells them to stay. 

Arabs serve in the Israeli government and Palestinians can enter Israel but not the opposite. Israel sends food, water and materials to Gaza and the West Bank daily which no one mentions and sure you can tell me about Lehi and Irgun who weren’t even part of Israel and actual problems like settler violence but it’s clear Israel didn’t do anything wrong and most criticisms by not just Palestinians but “Human Rights Groups” and the UN are refuted lies with no basis. People will criticize anything Israel does but never talk about modern slavery in the gulf, abuse of Christians in MENA or anything else like that. How come Jews don’t have the right of self determination or even the right to live in their land? This clearly shows dishonesty and a double-standard.

Instead, he allied with Nazi Germany and Facist Italy, deporting thousands of Jews to concentration camps (and their deaths).
 
Additionally, he recruited and encouraged many young Palestinian men to join the SS and fight for the Axis Powers (Germany, Japan, Italy). He also made many speeches encouraging and inciting violence and murder of Jews and gleefully aired antisemite propaganda in Palestine to encourage a strong cultural hatred for Jews (which survives to this day) .

He was arrested by France in 1945 for his connection with Nazi Germany, but escaped to Egypt a year later and continued inciting violence and slaughter of Jews, as well as refusals of ANY peace treaties until the day he died. 

YasserArifat was another Palestinian leader who refused all peace treaties and responded to attempts of mediation with violence and acts of terror. When offered the Oslo Peace treaty in July 2000, he responded by sending organized waves of suicide bombers into Israeli streets to kill as many civilians as possible, as well as other terrorist attacked aimed at civilians s The final Israeli death toll was 1184. 

In 2005 Israel evacuated its citizens from areas near the Gaza strip, as an offer of peace and a ‘buffer’ to end fighting and violence. The palestinians responded by sending missiles at civilians, again. 

In 2008, Israel once MORE offered a peace treaty to Arafats successor, Saeb Erekat denied all negotiation attempts by saying that they refuse to compromise or ‘’Budge one inch’’ from their demands.

In 2019,  the US offered Palestine ‘the deal of a century’ which gives Palestine 13% of Israeli territory in exchange for 3% of territory bordering other countries, and a plea for  them to simply STOP THEIR TERRORISM. It also offered a section of Jerusalem, although it retains the title of Israeli capital, basically splitting it and giving Palestine control of the East and North sides, so both religions that claimed the Holy City could have ownership. The deal also allowed Palestinians to live in Israeli territory as permanent citizens.  They denied. 

Time and time again, Palestine has taught and encouraged antisemitism and genocide towards the Jews, and have declined ANY possibility of a peace treaty, despite having many many chances.

I shouldn't have to remind people that the intifada was a series of bombings of men, women and children sitting on buses, in restaurants, schools, etc. And ""from the River to the Sea"" unambiguously means the ethnic cleansing of Jews from Israel.

Other Arabs would call me a traitor, but I don't give a shit. I am a moral person. And I believe supporting Israel is right thing to do while still hoping for peace and two state solution (eventually). 

I AM VERY RARE!! The average Arab is unlikely to have such political stance.

So what does the average Arab think about the Palestinian Israeli issue?

ALL OR NOTHING! 

And they believe that in the end of times, Muslims will fight the Jew in Palestine and [win](https://sunnah.com/riyadussalihin:1820)

It is even soooooo shameful if you live in an Arabic culture and you go around saying you support peace!

On the other hand I spoke to many Israelis who were so open to the idea of peace and do have Arabs living along side of them in Israel

It's very rare to find a Palestinian that is willing to make a compromise and agree to get only part of Palestine back. Anyone who negotiate ""peace"" with the Israeli regime is a considered by Arabs as a traitor. 

It's really tough in the Arab world to even support peace. You are called names in any discussion and labeled ""zionist sympathiser"" if you express any condemnation against the actions of Hamas. They think the attack is justified and Israel deserves it because Israel started it.

I must confess, I grew up hating Jews because the religious institution (in pre-2015 Saudi Arabia) used to preach jews hate. We were told that our very prophet was poisoned by a Jewish woman (to be fair Muhammad did kill her entire family). There is this idea in the Quran that ALL Jews hate Muslims and are always plotting to harm their interests. They can't be trusted. That's the gist you get from  reading the Quran. 

I really like this qoute (may cause butthurt to Arabs) by Golda Meir (PM of Israel between 1969 and 1974) ""Peace will come when the Arabs will love their children more than they hate us."" You would think that generalising often yields a wrong answer, but Golda knew what she was talking about. As an Arab I could tell you that in the Arab culture, it's not an obligation for Arab parents to love, respect and value their children, just provide money and shelter. They can treat you very horribly and socially you are expected to be nice and obedient towards your parents regardless. The UNICEF statistics shows that 80% of Palestinians physically abuse their children (as well as their wives). You can't deny that there is a problem in the culture. If the building block of society, which is family, is broken, then you must expect short temperment and emotional decision-making to be common among the average adult.

Please share this with your friends and family. Everyone in the west should know the realities of the situation so they can push their politicians to follow the right policy.

I don't know how can we fix the high level of antisemitism in the Muslim world. But I think we should rely on the friendly leaderships in the middle east to make peace. You can't win the hearts and minds of Arabs, I am going to make that very clear.",Positive_Ambition_63,t2_s52w3p7p,0.86,149,236

952,177ozzb,2023-10-14,IsraelPalestine,calling to 'decolonize' israel makes no sense,"I have seen that a lot of the discourse surrounding the current war uses the argument that Israel is a colonial state and that decolonization is always violent, or that colonization is inherently violent so violent decolonization is justified, or just generally that a colonial state is an imposition on the region and is unjust and illegitimate.

I think this idea that Israel is 'colonizing' at all is kind of a weak claim. Colonies are overseas settlement projects of domestic empires (british, french, spanish), and I can not think of any Jewish empire that has existed in history, nor even a strong centralized base for the Jews to have launched their colony from. 

Also, I think there is a massive implication in the word 'decolonize' which is that the colonizers go home, that they have somewhere to return to. Where would the jews in Israel go? what is there home? Yes, many came from European countries, but the notion that they traveled from these countries to go to Israel ignores something very key: they *fled* those European countries, because after the diaspora despite settling in many places, there was never a place in history the Jews went where they werent persecuted, ostracized, oppressed, or murdered, and so when they left these countries to go to the region of Palestine, where their ancestral, historical home was as a people, it was not much of a choice. and this is not to mention that the other, non European jews in Israel came from the surrounding middle eastern countries, but they did not just 'come' but fled those countries' pogroms as well. Where do the Israelis go back to when they 'decolonize' israel?

There is also the idea that it is colonization because only Palestinians are indigenous to the land, but this idea that there was not also jews living there throughout the centuries are false, and to be fair, the Palestinians who now refer to themselves as Palestinian and as the native inhabitants of Palestine were Syrians, Egyptians, Jordanians, until the fall of the ottoman empire, at which time a movement of indigineity by local identity *began*, but this too only really as a response to the recognition/institution of Israel as a state. 

The final question I have is what do about the entire population of jews in israel who were born in Israel, their parents born in Israel, wh have never lived anywhere else, do not know any other home, do not speak any language but Hebrew? When Israel is 'decolonized' and all the land is given back to the Palestinians and all the Jews go home, where do these people go, what's the idea? Decolonizing Israel is a call for these people to become refugees and it is a call for ethnic cleansing of Israeli Jews.",reusableteacup,t2_9q5rftm7,0.79,144,277
953,1749zvy,2023-10-10,IsraelPalestine,An important message to the world from Israel.,"Hello every one, my name is Daniel.  
  
I am an Israeli jewish living in northern Israel, close to Haifa.  
  
I'm here to write this post today because I want to share the story of what's happening in israel right now, from our own eyes.  
Yes, you might, and maybe reasonabely think that I'm going to be unobjective towards the latest events happened  
because I'm from the ""jewish side"" of the war.  
but let me tell you one thing, I was never one of those who say ""death to the arabs"" or ""all arabs are terrorists"" because they are not  
they are human beings just like us, I never supported or wanted innocent people to be hurt, and even though since I know myself  
we have always been brutally attacked, I never stopped believing that maybe we will be able to live in peace with our enemies, even after all that happened  
between us.  
  
  
In my country, whenever people hear the word ""palestine"" they get mad and angry, most people don't like the idea of palestinians calling themselves  
a ""state that deserves recognition"" because they would like to replace us.  
still, my opinion was always a little different, I always thought to myself that we don't need to shut down the idea of a ""palestinian people""  
because if this is what they believe and want to be, let them be, they deserve to be, they deserve to feel proud and stand for their flag with pride.  
My friends in my life don't really know my opinion, if most of them did, they would probably treat me differently, I don't blame them, both sides  
are just fueling each other with hate, palestinians call death to israel and israel call death to palestine, I don't blame my israeli friends nor the palestinians for  
saying that, this is what they were born to, this is what they know.  
let's make no mistakes, in all of those endless years of war between israel and terrorist organizations, innocent people died on BOTH SIDES, I never denied it, I never will.  
nothing makes me more sad than the sight of innocent people being killed for the sake of war, children, women, people who just want to live  
their lives in peace.  
  
  
The events of the last days may have shuttered the dream of peace between us and palestinians forever, this is sad, but this is the reality.  
I don't know if words can describe or if you guys can even start to comprehend the scale of brutality against humanity that happened in my country in the last days.  
now let me start off with a VERY CLEAR MESSAGE: this post has nothing to do about weather the palestinian resistance to Israel is justified or not and you will  
very soon understand why.  
  
  
let's say that palestinians resistance to our existance and hamas' war is justified, let's even say that they are right and we need to be demolished out of this land.  
This saturday, there was a holiday in Israel, ""sukkot"", on of the holiest and most important days for the jewish people, and yes in those days as on many holidays  
there were alot of celebrations and parties in Israel.  
one of those celebrations was a big psytrance festival called ""universo parelello Israel"" attended by 3500 young people that just wanted  
to listen to music, enjoy life and spread love, innocent people, unarmed, women, children.  
the party took place in an area about 10 - 15 minutes drive from gaza.  
at about 6 in the morning hamas started launching hundreds of rockets towards Israel, the party was of course stopped, dissapointed people who just wanted  
to celebrate were asked to live and run for their lives, police authority told them to escape and go back home.  
it took them alot of time to digest what is going on, so people started slowly leaving the area, now it doesnt take 5 minutes to leave a party like that.  
you need to rest a little, understand what is going on, pack all of your stuff, walk to the car, put everything inside and then slowly drive out with everybody.  
about 10 - 20 minutes after the party was closed and people were about to live, the area was still full of people, thousand of people, not knowing the hell  
that they are soon about to face.  
  
  
it was at that time that hamas monsters, inhuman pieces of garbange landed in that area and more areas in the country, they broke into the Israeli border  
through the land and through the air.  
they landed in the area of that party after probably seeing all thousand of people from the air and planning the attack on them.  
since they landed, the attack started, dosens of terrorists just started massacaring those thousand of young kids in the area, shooting EVERYONE with  
automatic kalachnikov's, EVERYONE.  
  
  
you can just imagine the panic and hell those guys felt, being shot from absolutely everywhere with automatic weapons, being slaughtered alive,  
people just tried to run for their lives, hiding everywhere possible, in every disgusting place you can imagine.  
all of that while stepping on bodies of other people, watching their friends brutally killed in front of their eyes, being shot again and again just to make sure  
they are dead, cars crashed, rolled over, people shot in their cars trying to escape, they burned cars with people inside them, people who managed  
to somehow escape this hell and hide somewhere had to stay on the ground barely breathing, for long HOURS, hearing their friends screaming in horror  
while shot brutally from every single place, people got kidnapped, they shot their legs so they won't be able to try and escape, they kidnapped  
young women and men, they shot innocent unarmed young men and women not only with AKs, but with RPGs, hand grenades, they slaughtered  
them with knives and cold blood weapons.  
  
  
There are unimaginable recorded calls of parents on the phone with their young children, trying to understand what the hell is going on  
with their kids, hearing everything going on LIVE on the phone call, people needed to listen to their dears trying to escape hell, while some of them  
heard their children dying in screams on the phone calls, yes, on the phone calls, I heard a recorded call of a girl screaming in the phone with her  
family hearing everything as she is begging for her life screaming ""NO PLEASE NO NO"", you hear gunshots and she is just getting calm realizing she got shot, that  
she is about to die, saying good bye to her lovers and hanging the phone.  
same horrifying stuff as 9/11 when people called their lovers to say good bye, but even more brutal.  
this is just ONE of thousands of stories like that.  
in that area alone, those pieces of garbage slaughtered 250 young people, and brutally injured THOUSANDS of innocent unarmed men and women.  
  
  
if you think it ends here, it didn't, it was just the beginning of the plan of one of the biggest massacres the world has even known.  
They broke into settlements and communities with all of their military equipment, and started running from house to house to house, slaughtering kids, women, disabled  
people, elders, everyone, just everyone.  
they shot young girls to death in front of their parents, leaving familys to suffer watching their dears dying in front of their eyes, recording  
filming, joking, laughing at them at their lowest point of their life while making live streams from the familys' stolen phones.  
they recorded all of that LIVE on those familys facebook and instagram accounts so everyone could see the horrors they are going through.  
they broke into secure spaces where people tried to desperately hide for their lives and just shot everyone brutally with automatic weapons, again, recording  
everything, how they shoot children and women to death with no honor or mercy.  
not only on houses and neighbourhoods, but also in the streets, they went out, running everywhere, killing EVERYONE, they massacred HUNDREDS  
of people in the streets, destroying entire familys in seconds everywhere.  
children 5 and 10 and 15 years old had to watch their parents shot to death in front of their eyes in their cars just driving to travel outside in this holiday, screaming  
for their lives in horror, until brave police officers risked their lives to rescue them out of the car, they have been there for long minutes screaming  
and begging for help and everything while their parents blood is spread all over them.  
all of those horrors are not even the tip of the iceberg.  
  
  
they slaughtered 1000 people, 1000 people, those 1000 people contain children, women, disabled people, elders and babys.  
Don't forget that all of this hell is happening while they keep shooting rockets at civilians EVERY SINGLE MINUTE.  
And the hostages, those garbages kidnapped women and BABYS, BABYS, WHAT THE HELL DO YOU KIDNAP A BABY FOR?  
WHY THE HELL DO YOU KIDNAP KIDS, WHY DO YOU KIDNAP ELDERS, WHAT TACTICAL ADVANTAGE DOES IT GIVE YOU, THIS IS DONE  
IN THE NAME OF SATANIC CRUELTY, AND THEY UPLOAD VIDEOS RECORDING THOSE KIDS, THOSE BABYS, LAUGHING AND IRRITATING THEM.  
HOW CRUEL CAN YOU BE?  
I wish that the faces of those miserable mothers that you broke their hearts to pieces will haunt you down to hell.  
  
  
You know, if those terrorists would come here with a target to occupy our country and defeat us, I wouldn't even write this post.  
One can understand and theoretically it is justified in a state of war to fight soldiers, fight police officers, conquer areas, kill armed men that  
can risk you in some way, if all they did was focusing on military and tactical targets, I wouldn't even condemn them as an enemy, because that is what you do  
in war, you kill the enemy soldiers, you kill armed men, those are the unwritten rules of war, and war is ugly.  
what happened here this saturday is FAR FAR FAR beyond ugly, FAR beyond war, FAR beyond cruel, what happened this saturday is SATANIC, listen to my words.  
listen to my words when I tell you we are dealing with not less then satanic monsters, and those satanic monsters are just a few kilometers away from us.  
and let me tell you, those monsters successfuly made our lives miserable every day and day since we exist, but I have NEVER, EVER imagined I will witness  
such things going on in my life, in my country, I never thought I would witness the massacre of 1000 innocent people in such a brutal way.  
those are by far the darkest days of my life, of our life here in israel, my people and country is gonna be left traumatic and scarred FOR EVER.  
  
  
I have absolutely no clue how those kids and children are going to live with the horrors they have witnessed and seen, no idea.  
If this is not the ULTIMATE PROOF for everyone in this world that those are satanic monsters, you are just closing your eyes.  
Those monsters targets are not tactical or political or what ever, those monsters did all of this FOR FUN.  
and let me tell you one more thing about them.  
If those idiots would really use the once in a lifetime chance they were somehow given to conquer Israel, and put all of their energy in tactical and military  
targets, who knows how much they could get closer to actual conquer.  
  
  
Don't lie to yourselves and tell yourselves heroic stories about how those monsters fought bravely for conquering the Israeli enemy.  
Those coward chickens, their last target was to conquer, last in the list of barbarically slaughtering and destroying and massacring kids and women.  
I honestly wanna thank Hamas deeply from my heart for one thing, we should thank them so much for doing all of the hard work for us by just stupidly documenting and recording everything  
uploading every single piece of evidence to the internet, showing all of the world how satanic and brutal they are, and what  
are their REAL targets, just look how stupid and idiotic they are, and they think people would actually believe their edited videos with cinematic music ""fighting"" soldiers.  
If someone ever could think to himself that we need to make peace with those monsters or live with them after those events, just watch those movies if your soul is brave enough  
and then come back here and say it, I DARE YOU.  
  
  
How can anyone support them? I honestly don't understand, if you support those monsters you are either STUPID or just EVIL.  
if you dont support those monsters I honestly don't care if you are against israel, if you think we have no rights to live here, anything, I would respect you.  
Yes, I say it LOUD AND CLEAR, I Respect our enemies, I respect those who want to conquer us, I respect those who want us out of the way  
but not like that, not what those monsters are doing, ""Enemies"" is a too honorable title for those monsters, those monsters are the face of evil  
those monsters are the lowest disgrace this planet has even known.  
  
  
And I tell you one more thing, to everyone in this world, listen to my message, you will sooner or later understand what you are dealing with.  
just imagine what would happen if those monsters would grow bigger.  
Israel is the shield of the middle east, Israel is the best country for muslims to live in, ask every muslim in this country  
if he would rather live here, work, study, grow, and be part of a normal society or live in Iran or Syria under demonic dictatorship.  
  
  
Hamas made the biggest mistake of their lives, the sealed their destiny, listen to my words, they would wish the never did it.  
I am so sorry that so many innocent people on both sides will suffer from this war, but next time you are coming here to blame us for it  
just remember that story and who lead their people into this, after years of making our lives miserable, we still tried everything to stay restrained.  
This time they have crossed the line by MILES.  
  
  
Our leadership is FURIOUS, our people are furious, and now those monsters will wish they would never been born.  
now that we have control over the situation inside Israel and we are out of the shock, we will haunt down every single member of  
that satanic group, and I promise you, I promise in the name of justice they will pay for their actions.

The article,

A leader and founding member of Hamas, Khalid Mashal, reportedly called for a global Jon Tuesday, asking Muslims around the world to target the people of Israel on Friday, Oct. 13.

This is breaking news that will be updated as more information becomes available. Keep reading below.

Video of Mashal’s reported call to violence was posted on YouTube and remains up on the platform as of Wednesday at 10 a.m.

According to a translation and analysis of the video by author Brother Rachid, Mashal referred to his proposed day of anger as “the Friday of Al-Aqsa flood,” which will “send a message of rage to Zionists and to America.”

“The most important thing: He asked all Muslims around the world to carry Jihad by their souls; to fight and be martyrs for Al-Aqsa. He wants Muslims to fight against the Jews, starting with Muslims who live in the countries surrounding Israel: Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, and Egypt (but also other countries), to go to the borders and try to enter, each by his own means,” Rachid explained. “He said: This is the time for Jihad to be applied on the ground rather than just in theory. He asked the Mujahedeen to go in long caravans to spell their blood on the land of Palestine.”

“Funds are important but today we are asking for your blood and souls \[to be sacrificed for Palestine\],” Mashal concluded, according to Rachid. /endarticle.

I guess we'll know pretty soon how far this thing can escalate.  If Muslims start rushing towards Israel, and attacking people in different countries, we may have another big problem on our hands.

955,157grjy,2023-07-23,IsraelPalestine,My experiences seem to be a huge inconvenience to the anti-Israeli movement,"A lot of you know me here and in other Israel/Palestine subs by now.

I'm not Jewish, Muslim, Arab, Palestinian or Israeli. I consider myself left-leaning, and I'm not religious in the slightest.

I'm British, but I've lived in a few places here and there. I served in the British Army and deployed on two operations, while sending soldiers on operations practically everywhere, including Afghanistan and Iraq.

Before my military service I traveled to Israel with an ex girlfriend, who's Israeli. I absolutely loved the place. The next time I returned I'd signed up to a ""Teach English in Palestine"" program, and lived with a Palestinian family in Hebron for a few months.

After my military service, I moved to Israel with a different ex-girlfriend, who I was engaged to (until recently). Now I'm in Tel Aviv on a work visa, deciding what to do next.

My experiences seeing Israel and living here during some of the recent spikes of rockets, attacks, and operations, and also living with a Palestinian family for several months in what is considered one of the hardest-hit cities in the West Bank, made me look at the conflict in a whole different light. My time in the British Army helps too... I know what's ""normal"" in a conflict, and what shouldn't happen.

I consider myself neutral in the conflict... I support a two state solution. There are hateful narratives about both countries, primarily that Israelis are racist and that Palestinians are terrorists. I stand up against both of these notions because they're simply not true.

Yet I see that the side my experiences seem to anger the most is the anti-Israeli side. When I explain that Israel is not a particularly racist country, I find people either claim I have only experienced a bubble of Israel, or some on Reddit claim they don't believe I had these experiences, as if I'm some kind of Israeli government agent planted to spread lies. The anti-Israel side can seriously push people away if they don't subscribe to their very specific, very curated, and sometimes fabricated narrative of events. I think this is demonstrated in the r/Israel and r/Palestine subs, where the former seems to be full of normal conversation, and the latter seems to be only about attacking Israel and nothing else. This is an enormous shame, because Palestine has a rich culture, a fascinating history, and some amazing people... most of whom are just getting on with their lives and don't care about politics.

This situation makes me pessimistic about the conflict. There are plenty of things we could criticize and discuss about Israel and the war... but instead we're wasting our time throwing soundbites and lies around, and demonizing anyone that doesn't believe them. Having a real discussion is virtually impossible.

This happened again in February 2019.

Considering the dangers associated with protesting a totalitarian regime, this seems like a pretty big deal. Yet, most people seem to be unaware this even happened, and it's hard to even find many sources that reported on it.

While the nature of the protests doesn't necessarily imply Gazans disagree with Hamas' actions towards Israel, and I expect more people living in Gaza to become radicalized in response to the war, I do find it at least a little bit hopeful to see them speaking out against Hamas' failed leadership. Which makes it all the more frustrating to see people who claim to be pro-Palestine defend Hamas and their actions that endanger Palestinian lives when even the Palestinians themselves risked their own safety to show us their discontent under Hamas' regime.",Anonymous_Cool,t2_tzm4gmc6,0.92,146,170

> Arab and Western officials say there is substance to Israeli claims of Hamas stockpiling supplies, including desperately needed food and fuel.

> Hamas has hundreds of thousands of gallons of fuel for vehicles and rockets; caches of ammunition, explosives and materials to make more; and stockpiles of food, water and medicine, the officials said. A senior Lebanese official said Hamas, which is estimated to number between 35,000 and 40,000, had enough stocked away to keep fighting for three to four months without resupply.

> While the blockade has left Gaza’s roughly 2 million people scraping by with what little food and water they scrounge up, it does not yet appear to have begun to degrade Hamas’s ability to fight.

> Hamas has said little of its supply situation — combatants rarely do — but the government it runs in Gaza says it has an emergency fuel stockpile that is quickly being depleted. “Hospitals, the ambulances and fire fighters’ machinery and civil defense trucks have been using the government emergency fuel store,” said Salama Marouf, who runs the government’s media office in Gaza.

> Fuel has taken on growing importance in recent days.

961,1766ke5,2023-10-12,IsraelPalestine,"Debunking the trope ""Israel created Hamas""","I've seen this breathtaking claim being made all across Reddit over the last few days, so I did a little research. The biggest source I found that makes this claim is [a video and article from The Intercept](https://theintercept.com/2018/02/19/hamas-israel-palestine-conflict/), a media outlet that has a left wing bias. If you watch the video and listen to the tone of the presenter, you can tell that he is almost gleeful in trying to make the point that anything that Hamas perpetrates against Israel is Israel's own doing.

But let's just follow the evidence they present, and see if it adds up to the claim they are making:

1) A quote from Yitzhak Segev, a former Israeli military governor in Gaza in the early 1980s, taken from a book called ""Arab and Jew: Wounded Spirits in a Promised Land"". In there (taken from Google Books search), I find this quote: ""...Segev once told me how he financed the Islamic movement as a counterweight to the PLO and the Communists. ""The Israeli government gave me a budget, and the military budget gives to the mosques"", he said. (That early funding helped nourish the seeds of Hamas and other Muslim movements that used terrorism to undermine the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.)""

2) A quote from Avner Cohen, a former Israeli religious affairs official who worked in Gaza for more than two decades, in an article from 2009 in the Wall Street Journal. The quote is as follows: ""“Hamas, to my great regret, is Israel’s creation.""

Both those points seem pretty damning at first, but if you actually [read the WSJ article from 2009](http://web.archive.org/web/20090926212507/http:/online.wsj.com/article/SB123275572295011847.html), you get a much deeper analysis of what happened, an analysis which does not support the conclusion being drawn by The Intercept.

I recommend reading the full article from WSJ, as it is very comprehensive and interesting. But I am going to quote some of the most relevant parts and highlight some relevant points:

> * The Palestinian cause was for decades l**ed
by the PLO**, which Israel regarded as a
**terrorist outfit** and sought to crush until the
1990s, when the PLO dropped its vow to
destroy the Jewish state.
* When Israel first encountered Islamists in Gaza in the 1970s and '80s, they seemed focused on
studying the Quran, **not on confrontation with Israel**. The Israeli government officially recognized
a precursor to Hamas called Mujama Al-Islamiya, registering the group as a charity. It allowed
Mujama members to set up an Islamic university and build mosques, clubs and schools.
Crucially, Israel often stood aside when the Islamists and their secular left-wing Palestinian rivals
battled, sometimes violently, for influence in both Gaza and the West Bank.
* When it became clear in the early 1990s that Gaza's Islamists had mutated from a religious
group into a fighting force aimed at Israel -- particularly after they turned to suicide bombings in
1994 -- **Israel cracked down** with ferocious force
* Mr. Segev says he had regular contact with Sheikh Yassin, in part to **keep an eye on him**. He
visited his mosque and met the cleric around a dozen times. It was illegal at the time for Israelis
to meet anyone from the PLO. Mr. Segev later arranged for the cleric to be taken to Israel for
hospital treatment. ""We had no problems with him,"" he says.
In fact, the cleric and Israel had a shared enemy: secular Palestinian activists. After a failed
attempt in Gaza to oust secularists from leadership of the Palestinian Red Crescent, the Muslim
version of the Red Cross, Mujama staged a violent demonstration, storming the Red Crescent
building. Islamists also attacked shops selling liquor and cinemas. The **Israeli military mostly
stood on the sidelines**.
Mr. Segev says the army didn't want to get involved in Palestinian quarrels but **did send soldiers**
to prevent Islamists from burning down the house of the Red Crescent's secular chief, a socialist
who supported the PLO
* Brig. Gen. Shalom
Harari, then a military intelligence officer in Gaza, says he received a call from Israeli soldiers
manning a checkpoint on the road out of Gaza. They had stopped a bus carrying Islamic
activists who wanted to join the battle against Fatah at Birzeit. ""I said: '**If they want to burn each
other let them go**,'"" recalls Mr. Harari.
A leader of Birzeit's Islamist faction at the time was Mahmoud Musleh, now a pro-Hamas
member of a Palestinian legislature elected in 2006. He recalls how usually aggressive Israeli
security forces **stood back and let conflagration develop**. He **denies any collusion** between his
own camp and the Israelis, but says ""they hoped we would become an alternative to the PLO.""
A year later, in 1984, the Israeli military received a tip-off from Fatah supporters that Sheikh
Yassin's Gaza Islamists were collecting arms, according to Israeli officials in Gaza at the time.
**Israeli troops raided a mosque and found a cache of weapons. Sheikh Yassin was jailed**. He told
Israeli interrogators the weapons were for use against rival Palestinians, not Israel, according to
Mr. Hacham, the military affairs expert who says he spoke frequently with jailed Islamists. **The
cleric was released after a year** and continued to expand Mujama's reach across Gaza.
* Mr. Harari, the military intelligence officer, says this and other warnings were ignored. But, he
says, t**he reason for this was neglect, not a desire to fortify the Islamists: ""Israel never financed
Hamas. Israel never armed Hamas**.""
Roni Shaked, a former officer of Shin Bet, Israel's internal security service, and author of a book
on Hamas, says Sheikh Yassin and his followers had a long-term perspective whose dangers
were not understood at the time. ""They worked slowly, slowly, step by step according to the
Muslim Brotherhood plan.""
* In 1987, several Palestinians were killed in a traffic accident involving an Israeli driver, triggering
a wave of protests that became known as the first Intifada, Mr. Yassin and six other Mujama
Islamists launched Hamas, or the Islamic Resistance Movement. Hamas's charter, released a
year later, is studded with anti-Semitism and declares ""jihad its path and death for the cause of
Allah its most sublime belief.""
Israeli officials, **still focused on Fatah and initially unaware of the Hamas charter, continued to
maintain contacts with the Gaza Islamists**. Mr. Hacham, the military Arab affairs expert,
remembers taking one of Hamas's founders, Mahmoud Zahar, **to meet** Israel's then defense
minister, **Yitzhak Rabin**, as part of regular consultations between Israeli officials and Palestinians
not linked to the PLO. Mr. Zahar, the only Hamas founder known to be alive today, is now the
group's senior political leader in Gaza.
In 1989, Hamas carried out its first attack on Israel, abducting and killing two soldiers. Israel
**arrested Sheikh Yassin and sentenced him to life. It later rounded up more than 400 suspected
Hamas activists,** including Mr. Zahar, and deported them to southern Lebanon. There, they
hooked up with Hezbollah, the Iran-backed A-Team of anti-Israeli militancy.

I don't know how anyone can read this article and come to the conclusion ""Israel created Hamas"". It clearly lays out the Hamas was founded by Islamists who, **before creating Hamas**, were political rivals of the PLO, a terrorist group famous for high profile attacks such as Entebbe, Munich and Black September. The Islamists were at first a charitable and educational outfit (and Israel may have contributed some money to the mosques to facilitate aid and education in Gaza), and when they became militant they were fighting against the PLO, and not Israel. Israel kept an eye on the group fighting against their enemy, the PLO, and tolerated their existence, i.e. they did not interfere when they battled the PLO, but on occasion did in fact intervene when they went to far, and in fact jailed the leader Sheikh Yassin when he started to hoard weapons. A few years later Hamas was actually founded, and when they attacked Israel they immediately cracked down on them by arresting their leader, sentencing him to life, and deporting hundreds of their members to Lebanon. Both Israel and Hamas deny any collusion between the two.

There is no proof Israel ever armed Hamas, there is no proof Israel ever financed Hamas. There is evidence Israel tolerated the precursor group to Hamas, a group that had never attacked Israel, by standing aside and observing them, and intervening only occasionally. 

This claim has been twisted by people who want to show that anything that Hamas does to Israel is Israel simply reaping what they have sown. The truth is, Israel never gave any material support to Hamas. Hamas has been built up into what they are today by direct funding and supplies from the regime in Iran.",briskt,t2_4ae2z,0.65,135,336

If your plan is just ""Free Palestine"", it's not a plan. The attack by Hamas clearly didn't improve the lives of the Gazans. Hamas is a violent and terroristic organization, if you just support it then you're supporting them repeatedly attacking the Israelis till they lash out. That's not a plan, that's encouraging suicide of the Gazan people. Even if you think Israel is evil, it's still not a plan.

Killing all the Muslims isn't a plan, and the IDF aren't following that. I haven't seen too many super racist Israelis. They have a plan to kill all of Hamas, the terroristic group that organized an attack, and they are carrying it out because they feel forced into it. If you feel they should stop, you need to produce a plan that will realistically stop the rocket attacks and violence.

The whole region has been hurt by delusional people without a plan who pushed their ideals with no thought of the future. Outsiders were fine with donations being used to arm Hamas and wage war, because they supported the struggle. The struggle isn't doing anything good for Gaza now, and the lack of infrastructure is killing them. People repeatedly push Israel to stop fighting, and the end result has been more violence by Hamas, which isn't a plan with any future.

Seek out people with a realistic plan to end the violence and improve society, not people who show you instagram pictures and catchy headlines and push a catchphrase.

970,16gbn2z,2023-09-11,IsraelPalestine,Why I left the Pro-Palestine movement,"The following describes my experiences as a young Jewish woman entering, and then leaving, the pro-Palestinian movement. I have, for obvious reasons, tried to leave out identifying details. Thank you to everyone who gave me the nudge to tell this story.

TLDR: The ‘pro-Palestine' movement lied to me and preyed upon personal vulnerabilities so I would act as a fig leaf for their antisemitism. I eventually discovered how callous they were with Jewish lives and the extent to which their real motivations did not align with anything that benefits the Palestinian people. I now believe that similarly uninformed ‘international input’ may be a driver in the conflict.

_Entering Activism._ I made the worst decision of my life when I took the advice of some people who told me that a degree from an American university was best, and enrolled in an American university as a college freshman. I had lived in America before, so I thought I would be able to handle myself and I felt rather ‘worldly’ at 18 — which really just meant that I didn’t know how to say, ‘I don't know.’ It seemed impossible to me, given my ethnic/national background, that I would know so little about the conflict… but at that time, I could barely distinguish the West Bank from Gaza. At first, I tried to steer clear of the topic, but this ended when I became extremely invested in a major ‘hot button issue’ in the US at that time — a particular pipeline running through historically Native American land. This is how I met a group of people who would change my life for the worse: a loose-knit collective of leftist activists who taught me the difference between leftism (the good one) and liberalism (very bad!) — between cultural appropriation and cultural appreciation — between bisexual and pansexual (oh boy). Suddenly, I was a social justice warrior not from behind a keyboard, but in person — first we carpooled to protests, and then at some point, we were the ones organising the protests. 

_’How big of an activist were you really?’_ Not very big, lol! We were little fish in a big pond. My crowning achievement of the activist phase was when I met a big-name politician at one of my protests. I never appeared on tv or did interviews (although I eventually did manage to spark some far-right backlash and a tiny online doxxing effort). It ended there, thankfully. 

_’So how’d you get into this issue?’_ As I ‘unlearned my internalised prejudice’ and ‘activized,’ I kept getting drawn closer to the topic of I/P, which as I’ve mentioned, I had about an ankle-depth knowledge of. I remember one of the first big conversations we had about it, where they went on a vitriolic rant about all the ways Israel was bad, and then they stopped, and let the silence hang — this was my time to either cement my ‘membership’ or get kicked out. I uncomfortably said some version of ‘yeah, fuck Israel!’ They made it sound like an open and shut case, and what would I do about it? Just stand aside? No chance! I had to let Israel know that I _as a Jew_ didn’t want them to do these things! _As a Jew,_ I had to do something about the atrocities being committed ‘in my name!’ (I specifically remember using that phrase, which honestly makes me cringe to even type)

_My exact political positions._ I actually wouldn’t have been able to remember in great detail since there is a lot of water under the bridge, except that while doing some lazy googling I recently stumbled upon an old Quora thread asking ‘who is right, Israel or Palestine?’ And one of the top answers was an Israeli saying, ‘as an Israeli, I’m telling you that you should support Palestine, because they need your support more.’ And that brought back to me the entire old chain of logic. That’s how I thought. I sincerely believed that Israel was under no threat — but the Palestinians were. (Note the deceptive phrasing, which was common at the time: Israel was a monolith, whereas Palestinians were many individual human beings) I believed that it was our duty to impress upon the stronger actor the necessity of doing better in all respects, and support the Palestinians in their struggles as the downtrodden and disfavoured (_it’s not fair that one kind of person has better quality of life than another, just based on where they were born!_ thought I). I believed that Israel had the power to end the conflict and create lasting peace. I believed that the Palestinian demands were reasonable (yet somehow, we never spent any time actually discussing the deals which have been on the table) but at the same time I believed that the harm which had been done to them was probably too vast to ever fully be repaired. Perhaps most embarrassingly, I believed that if enough people said ‘No Israel! Stop doing the bad things!’ Israel would realise that there was a better way, and would stop doing the bad things, and then the world would be a better place.

_Why I started to doubt._ It was getting to the point where, having turned out for all kinds of actions on all kinds of other issues, at some point soon I was going to either have to go and hold up a Palestinian flag on a college campus, or make a huge life change — and I already had doubts brewing. I’d been avoiding a direct, physical presentation of this sentiment because I had eventually done some research, and things didn’t add up. There was so much that they left out of the narrative, so many inconsistencies, and maybe in the back of my mind there was even something assimilated from my background that made me think… this doesn’t feel right. 

_The breaking point._ But then there was a major shooting at a synagogue in the US and someone I know was personally affected. This was a crucial moment in my life. I truly believed that I would become the recipient of the support which we had been giving to every other marginalised, disaffected group when something bad happened to them — but the silence was deafening. I asked what we were doing about this and they said how awful it was but… nothing. No action was planned. No major show of solidarity with the Jewish community. Quietly, questions of — were the congregations Zionist? trickled around, just out of earshot (but one other person later confirmed my suspicions that the question was asked.) There was a sense of dissatisfaction, like the attack was an inconvenient distraction from ‘the main story’ — and I saw for the first time that I had fallen for a scam. Treat my time and energy like money — now think of the _’first they come for x, then they come for-‘_ thing — now imagine this was like me investing in the human rights pension fund. I keep putting money in for the collective defense of human rights, and eventually I’m the one whose rights need defending, and all the people I’ve stood up for will now stand up for me.

Right? Wrong. Not if you are Jewish.

_My current political positions._ I am staunchly pro-Israel. I believe in taking small, unsexy, bureaucratic steps to lessen the friction between the two parties so we can cohabitate in this area with less violence. Things like: they get rid of the martyr’s fund and we make some significant changes in our permit-issuing systems to speed along their economic development. I also strongly believe that the world needs to stop pandering to or even passively accepting any viewpoints which imply genocide: ‘from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free’ should earn jail time in Western countries. We must also have international funding reforms: the states who contribute to the PA/UNRWA/etc. must use their leverage to force anticorruption measures. Speaking of UNRWA, it must be abolished immediately and all Palestinian refugees must be resettled under the mandate of the UNHCR. We cannot continue to play to the fantasy that Israel will vanish: we must address the plight of the Palestinians in a sustainable way which inches towards stable, limited autonomy (without falling on our own sword in terms of security, and expecting the international community to stop the bleeding, as ‘antizionist jews’ do). But perhaps the most important thing I can contribute is to say that a viewpoint which would centre Palestinian lives requires separating the Palestinian political leadership’s goals from the wellbeing of the Palestinian people. Who is served by keeping them in the camps without resettlement? The political leaders, for whom they are a bargaining chip. Who is served by intifadas? The Palestinian leadership, for without the chaos which places Israel as the convenient scapegoat, their incompetent governance would be plain for the world to see and they could not continue to redirect domestic discontent. Why would the Palestinian leadership even want to improve the conditions of the people when the international aid rolls in only on the basis of well-publicised deplorable conditions? We are all falling for it: the propagandised Palestinian population, the international community which pays to keep the status quo grinding along painfully, and of course you, my pro-palestinian reader who believes that you’re going to create positive change in the world by commenting ‘free Palestine’ on any post featuring an Israeli or, dare I say it, sometimes just a Jew.

I am an imperfect messenger but my message is my truth, so I challenge you to skip any critiques of my writing style or word choice and address the substance of what I have said.

Edit to add a point of clarification:

_To what extent was I victimized?_ I’m seeing some debate about this — were they coercive? Did I have agency?

On an individual level, no, I did not ever fear for my physical safety, although I’m guessing that if I had stated a strongly Zionist stance at that time it would have resulted in some degree of harassment and severe social ostracisation. I absolutely had agency: I could have stayed away from all of this and wiser 18 year old Jews did. I made a mistake, and I own that — this is a part of me trying to make it right. When I say I was preyed upon, I mean that they took advantage of specific weaknesses related to me and my background which made me an ideal target for this. My sexuality, my family dynamics, and a lot of things which I didn’t reveal in this post all played a crucial role in how I ended up in this group. But what I wanted to focus on here is that they used my desire to do good in the world to make me complicit in something that I now find abhorrent, and I believe they exploited characteristics of 18-year-old me which a lot of other people that age have in common — and if you’re not on some level sensitized to antisemitism (ie, by being Jewish) then you might never get the wake-up call that I did. What I want people to take away from this is a better understanding of how this ideology is spread on college campuses, not whether I personally am an idiot or a victim.

972,12rstm5,2023-04-19,IsraelPalestine,My Grandmother Is Older Than Israel,"A talking point that is beloved by Palestine supporters on Twitter and elsewhere is ""my grandmother is older than Israel."" [Here's an example.](https://twitter.com/Nadia_Shammas_/status/1392333481791922181) It's extremely common. 

This talking point is a good example of the kind of intellectual dishonesty and moral inconsistency that is so common among pro-Palestine talking points. Their point is that because Israel is a young state, that means it shouldn’t exist? I guess? Or that its legitimacy is in question because of its age? I'm honestly not sure, but the talking point is spammed constantly, usually on pro-Israel tweets, so I assume it's some kind of ""gotcha"" for Zionists. 

Taken at face value, the Israel they're talking about is the State of Israel (as opposed to the land of Israel or the concept of Israel or Israel Kamakawiwo’ole) which was founded in 1948. If that is the case, then yes, their grandmother is most likely older than Israel, as I’m sure are a lot of people’s grandparents. Why this is problematic I have no idea, but they seem to think so.

But what’s funny is then these same Palestine supporters don't apply their own logic and standards to their own beloved Palestine. If Israel is 75 years old, having been founded in 1948, and not as old as your grandmother, then Palestine is only 35 years old, as the state of Palestine was founded in 1988. Which means forget about your grandmother, I'M older than Palestine, and so are half of millennials. 

Another state that is currently fighting for its survival, Ukraine, only gained independence in 1991, which means it’s younger than Palestine and is barely old enough to drink. Vladimir Putin is older than Ukraine. For some reason such logic doesn’t apply here.

As always, Palestine supporters hold Israel to one standard and Palestine to an entirely different one. If Israel has no or little legitimacy because your grandmother is older than it, then Palestine has twice as little legitimacy because it's half Israel's age. It’s pretty clear these kinds of talking points are used only because they sound good, not because they are factually true or make even a lick of sense.",TracingBullets,t2_w8btvkv3,0.83,114,203
973,176r1th,2023-10-13,IsraelPalestine,"Those who think Israel should ""strive for peace"" at this current moment are 100% delusional","Regardless of what anyone thinks about the long standing conflict - Hamas has kidnapped 150 Israelis and still has them (alive or dead is another question). The resolution is simple: All Hamas has to do is give back the hostages.

To me, it is delusional that anyone should think Israel should make the first gesture towards peace at this current moment, when Hamas is still holding 100+ people. It amazes me that anyone thinks that in this particular instance that Israel the aggressor. It's awful what's happening on both sides, the human suffering is hard to see online. The finger should be pointed at Hamas. I cannot believe the barbarity of the attack - kids, young women and the elderly. Beheading soldiers. Reports of rape.

If Hamas was hoping for a way to effect positive outcome for Palestinians (I doubt so), this was not it! It's a very simple case of actions having consequences. How can anyone think such evil is justified?

Common arguments I see around this:

* ""Israel has been doing this for xyz years"" doesn't even make sense - Israel never killed kids, young and elderly deliberately and maliciously, never beheaded people and paraded their bodies around, nor kidnapped people and threatened to kill them if they didn't get their way. This situation is not even comparable to the sins of Israel.
* ""Israel is violating international rules of war"" is a daft argument. Again, killing kids and the elderly, kidnapping, beheading bodies etc are clearly blatant violations of rules of war. The UN wants Israel to stick perfectly to these rules and has yet to even publicly condemn Hamas. Absolutely laughable.
* ""Israel started it"" - So that justified killing children and the elderly? The ""Israel started it"" argument is not even an argument, Hamas had multiple opportunities at peace. On 7th October they woke up and chose violence.

EDIT: *Apparently the UN has condemned both Hamas and Israel (*[*source*](https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/176r1th/comment/k4o3pql/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)*).

_____
  
1) **Hamas is the government of West Palestine (Gaza)** and rules over 40% of the Palestinian population. It is misleading to simply refer to them as a ""mere terrorist group"", giving the impression that they are some fringe group that doesn't represent the will of the people.
  
Hamas holds absolute power in West Palestine and has control over every citizen's life. From education, to healthcare, to enforcing law and order, to buildings, to utilities, to its military. Every aspect is being controlled by Hamas.
  
Saying that it was Hamas that massacred Israeli civilians does not properly accurately portray the amount of power that they have. Instead of saying that _""The Japanese bombed Pearl Harbour""_, it would be more akin to saying that _""The Imperial Rule Assistance Association bombed Pearl Harbour but most Japanese just want peace""_.

2) **Hamas is Palestinian.** It's not like they are some foreign group operating in Palestine with no relation to the Palestinian people. Hamas leadership is Palestinian, it's party members are Palestinian, it's army is Palestinian. They are every bit as Palestinian as the average citizen.

- A similar poll done by AP shows that Hamas enjoys a [52% approval rating across all Palestinian territories](https://apnews.com/article/hamas-middle-east-science-32095d8e1323fc1cad819c34da08fd87)
    
Thousands of Palestinians were also celebrating on the streets shortly after Hamas militants returned and started parading dead bodies and hostages around. They beat the bodies up, spat at them, and stepped on them. Palestinians were waving flags and handing out candy.
    
It would appear from the above that the Palestinians largely support the actions of their government.

Summary:
  
Hamas's role in Gaza goes beyond the label of a ""terrorist group."" As the governing body in West Palestine (Gaza), they exert significant influence over daily life and administrative tasks. Portraying them as a separate entity from the Palestinians can be misleading, insinuating a disconnect between Gaza and the larger Palestinian populace.

976,17llp02,2023-11-01,IsraelPalestine,Insane new argument that Palestinians “Generously let Jews in” during the holocaust.,"I keep seeing this new take all over the internet that Palestinians generously let Jews in during the Holocaust and the Jews betrayed them and stole their land. Yes really. 

For starters Palestine was a British colony from 1917-1948 and in that time period it had open borders which means anyone could come in. While many Jews did in fact migrate there during this time, Jews have been migrating back to Israel since the early Islamic period but for the most part since the 1890’s 

Actually, the Jewish migrations were an issue for the Arabs living there and many of them decided to Riot, around the 1930’s a Palestinian Mufti named Amin Al Husseini who was a Mufti left the region and went to Fascist Italy. Later, Husseini went to Germany and befriended Adolf Hitler where (at that time) he had been expelling Jews and putting them into Ghettos. Husseini here befriended Hitler and eventually he suggested that he kill the Jews because Husseini didn’t want them to come to British Palestine and since Hitler wanted to kill the Jews anyway, he agreed. 

During and After the holocaust many Jews migrated to the region from Europe but so did many people from neighboring countries, about 1 million people from neighboring countries such as Jordan, Lebanon and Egypt migrated to the region as workers since the british payed more money than their own countries and these people stayed there until they died and many Palestinians are in fact descendants of these people. 

So no, Palestinians didn’t generously let Jews in and the Jews didn’t betray the Palestinians and steal their land.",VeryHungryMan,t2_ka4xt6x6,0.79,103,186

978,148yaz0,2023-06-14,IsraelPalestine,The notion that 'Jews stole Palestinian land to create Israel' is rooted in Arab Supremacism,"It is actually unbelievable just how wrong this widespread, anti-semitic mantra is on so many levels that even some of Israel's less informed supporters online fail to deconstruct it properly - which, upon doing so, we will discover that we are left with nothing but a complete mess of contradictions and naked Arab supremacist fascism of the most abhorrent kind. Whenever I present this breakdown in 'certain' circles on Reddit, among vehement anti-Zionists, it is so irrefutably compelling that almost every single one of them simply dropped their mask and begun openly espousing Arab racial supremacy and entitlement over Jews or insulted me rather than address any of those points, so it would be great if any fans of the mantra would be able to refute them in this thread.  


**1. All the Jewish Zionists who fought the Arab Nationalists during the outbreak of the 1948 Independence War were, themselves, Palestinians.**  


That's right, this sentence is enough to blow the minds of 90% of Redditors - Jewish ( Religion/Ethnicity ), Zionist ( Ideology ) and Palestinian ( Residency/'Nationality' ) are not mutually exclusive. Whenever a Redditor repeats that stupid mantra, what they're actually saying is 'Palestinians stole Palestinian land', while singling out their Jewishness as a reason for not 'deserving' any self-determination or continued residency. For clarification purposes and to cut down on unnecessary text, I will provide a [rundown](https://i.imgur.com/2TPaOe4.png) in image format on the distinctions between various designations and what their relevant meanings were prior to Israel's independence, as the language dynamically changed since then.   


Like it or not, much as with citizenship today, any Jewish immigrant, be they from the British or Ottoman immigration waves, received a passport or residency certification which made them as Palestinian as any other Palestinian of any given ethnicity, most of whom settled down in Palestine from a broad at some point and receiving documentation from the ruling Empire of their time, marking them as Palestinians.  


This is something which Arab fascists really don't like to hear, which brings us to the next step of the breakdown:  


**2. ""These European invaders/colonialists/infiltrators/thieves/\[Insert derogatory buzzword here\] weren't REAL Palestinians""**  


The flimsy reasoning at play here tends to arbitrarily fluctuate between fascists, with the core tenet always being tied to recency of habitation or insufficient ancestry - some saying that every Jew born abroad who came to Mandatory Palestine is an 'invader' who does not count as a 'real' Palestinian ( And thus has no say in its territory ), some will say that any Jewish family which came after the Ottoman era is illegitimate, some will say that the 'True super-real legit Palestinian Jews' are only the ones who lived the before the advent of Zionism itself, some that only Jews who do not object to total Arab rule are 'real Palestinian Jews', and finally a laughably a-historical and ironic theory which is extremely popular in Arab subreddits - that Palestinian-Arabs are, overwhelmingly or to a man, descended from an unbroken lines of ""Canaanites"" dating back 4,000 years even as the former went completely extinct from the historical record by 1,000BC already, and that by this virtue anyone who comes to 'their' land must do so with their approval.  


For a cause so championed by 'leftists', all of these contentions bear a striking resemblance to far-right rhetoric in other countries - This immigrant is not *really* German, he wasn't born here. This immigrant is not *really* British, his family only came during the last decades, they haven't been toiling the countryside for centuries like mine has! Often times, 'cutoff points' are invented simply for the sake of disguising the opposition to any individual that does not belong to a certain ethnicity. This is why a lot of them enjoy marking Ottoman Rule as a cutoff point because Jewish demographics at the time are negligible enough not to threaten their Arab hegemony.  


As is the case with American white supremacists, this is made doubly ironic by the fact that the majority of Palestinian-Arabs are *descendants of immigrants* themselves. To dispel the last 'cutoff point' in their list, no, they are absolutely *not* 'The Canaanites' of the Southern Highlands or the Land of Israel from 4,000 years ago. While they might be Arabized \*Levantines\* rather than strictly Arabian, almost every Palestinian-Arab city, town, community, etc has been established via migration at some point following the Jewish and Samaritan revolts by foreigners from neighboring countries. I don't want to expand too much on that this thread, but look up the foundation of Nablus, Modern Ramallah or Population of Jund Filastin on Wikipedia for more.  


Also, most Redditors have no clue how interpret Genetic studies. Your link which tells you that Palestinian-Arabs cluster closely to Ancient Canaanite DNA also tells you that the same is true for Lebanese Christians, Jordanians, and Southern Syrians. Do all of them come from the territory of modern-day Israel and Palestine? Not, it just means that 'Canaan' encapsulated a much larger border and also that nearby populations were not too far apart. Phoenicians, Nabateans, Decapolis inhabitants, all had 'Canaanite DNA' - The Canaanites who used to live in Israel however were long gone or identified as Israelites. When Jewish presence was vastly reduced by the Romans, the void was filled by neighboring Semites.   


None of the Arab supremacist objections to the 'legitimacy' of or political rights of Jewish migrants has any consistency or basis in law or morality. An Arab who came to Palestine in 1680 is a 'bona fide Palestinian', but a Polish Jew who came in 1920 is an 'invader' and 'not really Palestinian'. Not only that, but Palestinian-Arabs also considered any Egyptian or Syrian that  moved over as lately as the last Jew to be a valid Palestinian. The criteria is simple - You must either be an Arab by blood or support Arab domination over the entire Mandate to qualify.  


Which brings us to the next point:  


**3. Arab 'Blood and Soil' dogma**  


Inexplicably for anyone who has not already bought into Arab Supremacism, and very similarly other fascist movements of the time or radical Jewish factions that declare the entire land to be rightfully theirs which they despise so much, Arab Supremacists believe that, for some reason, every inch of Mandatory Palestine is the inheritance of Arab Nationalists alone and nobody else is allowed to have any other plans for it without consulting them first, even when the land in question is either Jewish private property or British sovereign property.  


According to this doctrine, the soil itself is fundamentally Arab or ""Palestinian"" as a codewrod for non-Jewish, Arab Palestinian and Arab inhabitants of Palestine exude some mystical aura of 'land claiming' in a radius around them that Jews do not. Thus if an Arab moves to Palestine in 1680 and builds a village in some plain and in 1920 his descendants become political activists demanding an independent Arab state, that is all fine and dandy. Meanwhile if a Jew builds a village in 1880 at the next field over and his descendants campaign for an independent Jewish state, they are 'stealing Palestinian land' and 'colonizing Palestine'. Why? Because Arabs are the master race.   


**4. Appeal to Britain**


The final point is once again steeped in deep irony, as in order to maintain their haphazard narratives, Arab Supremacists resort to both rejecting the authority or legitimacy of the European colonial powers ( And assigning them exclusively to Arabs instead ) when it's convenient while at the same time invoking their sovereign authority in order to undermine Jews, in a manner which utterly contradicts itself.  


They'll argue that Britain had no right to govern Middle-eastern people and territories whatsoever and therefore all of their actions are void and null, while at the same time claiming that the borders of British *Mandatory Palestine,* which are not even the same borders of *Ottoman Filastin,* are the indisputable ancestral lands of Palestinian-Arabs and that anyone touching them is actually 'stealing lands' from the nation of Palestine.  


Just to stress the absurdity here, by this logic if the British woke up one day and decided to pressure France to incorporate half of Syria into Mandatory Palestine, and the Zionists settled there, the Grand Mufti and other assorted Arab Supremacists would be screaming that ""their lands"" are being stolen, even as they *do not recognize British legitimacy or sovereignty*.   


This gives rise to the shaky argument that, because the Mandate was delineated under certain borders, then all of it *must* become one sovereign state within similar borders, or that because Palestinian-Arabs were the majority demographic of the Mandate, that means all decisions must be made by referendum of everyone living within Mandate boundaries ( To grant Arabs the final say ). Ignoring the fact that such a practice was completely unheard of by almost anyone at the time, and that the principle of a 'national vote' is only applicable to sovereign nations for a reason, it also falls flat on its face considering that these borders themselves were put in place by Great Britain. In Ottoman times, the division of provinces looked more like [this](https://honestreporting.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Palestine_Map-D-Part-2-800x1024.jpg).   


If we must abide by British border drawing when it comes to the first iteration of the Mandate, then they also have the legitimacy to alter the Mandate's borders as the situation calls for it - you cannot have your cake and eat it.  


**Final questions**  


In conclusion, here are a few questions for those who follow the ""All Zionists live on stolen 'Palestinian' land"" libel:  


* Did the Jewish enclaves that still remained in all the periods during which various immigrants poured into the province of Palestine after the fall of Rome have the right to tell them to get out of their land? Were the ancestors of modern-day Palestinian Arabs, who obtain settlement permit from distant empires without going door to door to consult the Jewish communities who were living there for centuries before them at the time if they consent to it, actually stealing Jewish land from the Jewish people? Would that make the Arab State of Palestine an 'illegitimate' settler-colonial state like Israel supposedly is today?  

* If the Jews of Tiberias, a city which has been majority Jewish for centuries, decided that they don't wish to be governed by whichever Syrian King or Baathist dictator was slated to rule 'All-Palestine', do they have the right to maintain their own sovereignty in its midst like Lichtenstein, would they have to defer to the wishes of nearby Arabs because Arabs are superior and automatically entitled to all lands, or would they have to defer to the scared Mandate borders laid down by Britain, and if so, why would that no longer be true if Britain changes its mind?  

* Is a Palestinian who arrived in the 1900's from Egypt, such as Yasser Arafat, actually a Palestinian? Is it okay for him to participate in political movements that seek to claim public lands formerly in the possession of Great Britain for a new sovereign state in accordance with their vision and desired borders? If so, why is it bad for a Jew who arrived in the 1900's and holds a Palestinian passport to do the same thing?",Negerenao15,t2_sxttrgkj,0.78,95,161

[https://twitter.com/Ike\_Saul/status/1711780282725011520](https://twitter.com/Ike_Saul/status/1711780282725011520)

&#x200B;

""People ask me all the time if I am ""pro-Israel"" because I am a Jew who has lived in Israel, and my answer is that being ""pro-Israel"" or being ""pro-Palestine"" or being a ""Zionist"" does not properly capture the nuance of thought most people do or should have about this issue. It certainly doesn't capture mine.  
  
I have a lot to say. I’ve spent the last 72 hours writing, texting, and talking to Israelis, Jews, Muslims, and Palestinians. Much of my reaction is going to piss off people on ""both sides,"" but I am exhausted and hurting and I do not think there is any way to discuss this situation without being radically honest about my views. So I'm going to try to say what I believe to be true the best I can.  
  
Let me start with this: It could have been me.  
  
That's a hard thought to shake when watching the videos out of Israel — the concert goers fleeing across an empty expanse, the hostages being paraded through the streets, the people shot in the head at bus stops or in their cars. I went to those parties in the desert, I rubbed shoulders with Israelis and Arabs and Jews and Muslims, I could have easily accepted an invitation to some concert near Sderot and gone without a care, only to be indiscriminately slaughtered. Or, perhaps worse, taken hostage and tortured.  
  
I don’t believe Hamas is killing Israelis to liberate themselves, nor do I believe they are doing it to make peace. They're doing this because they represent the devil on the shoulder of every oppressed Palestinian who has lost someone in this conflict. They're doing it because they want vengeance. They are evening the score, and acting on the worst of our human impulses, to respond to blood with blood — an inclination that is easy to give in to after what their people have endured. It should not be hard to understand their logic — it is only hard to accept that humans are capable of being driven to this. Not defending Hamas is a very low bar to clear. Please clear it.  
  
It’s not possible to recap the entire 5,000 year history of people fighting over this strip of land in one newsletter. There are plenty of easily accessible places you can learn about it if you want to (and, by the way, many of you should — far too many people speak on this issue with an obscene amount of ignorance, loads of arrogance, and a narrow historical lens focused on the last few decades). But I'll briefly highlight a few things that are important to me.  
  
In my opinion, the Jewish people have a legitimate historical claim to the land of Israel. Jews had already been expelled and returned and expelled again a half dozen times before the rise of the Muslim and Arab rule of the Ottoman Empire. Of course it’s messy because we Jews and Arabs and Muslims are all cousins and descendents of the same Canaanites. But Arabs won the land centuries ago the same way Israel and Jews won it in the 20th century: Through conflict and war. The British defeated the Ottoman Empire and then came the Balfour Declaration, which amounted to the British granting the area to the Jewish people, a promise they’d later try to renege on — all before the wars that have defined the region since 1948.  
  
That historical moment in the late 1940s was unique. After World War II, with many Arab and Muslim states already in existence, and after six million Jews were slaughtered, the global community felt it was important to grant the Jewish people a homeland. In a more logical or just world that homeland would have been in Europe as a kind of reparation for what the Nazis and others before them had done to the Jews, or perhaps in the Americas — like Alaska — or somewhere else. But the Jews wanted Israel, the British had taken to the Zionist movement, the British had conquered the Ottoman Empire which handed them control of the land, and America and Europe didn’t want the Jews. As a result, we got Israel.  
  
The Arab states had already rejected a partitioned Israel repeatedly before World War II and rejected it again after the Holocaust and the end of the war. They did not want to give up even a little bit of their land to a bunch of Jewish interlopers who were granted it all of a sudden by British interlopers who had arrived a hundred years prior. Who could blame them? It had been centuries since Jews lived there in large numbers, and now they wanted to return in waves as secularized Europeans. Many of us would probably react the same way. So, just as humans have done forever, they fought. The many existing Arab states turned against the burgeoning new Jewish state. One side won and one side lost. This is the brutal and broken and violent world we live in, but it is what created the global world order we have now.  
  
Are Israelis and British people ""colonizers"" because of this 20th century history? Sure. But that view flattens thousands of years of history and conflict, and the context of World War I and World War II. I don’t view Israelis and Brits as colonizers any more than the Assyrians or the Babylonians or the Romans or the Mongols or the Egyptians or the Ottomans who all battled over the same strip of land from as early as 800 years before Jesus’s time until now.

You can’t speak about this issue in a vacuum. You can't pretend that it wasn't just 60 years ago when Israel was surrounded on all sides by Arab states who wanted to wipe them off the face of the planet. Despite the balance of power shifting this century, that threat is still a reality. And you can't talk about that without remembering the only reason the Jews were in Israel in the first place was that they'd spent the previous centuries fleeing a bunch of Europeans who also wanted to wipe them off the face of the planet.

It's NOT anti-semitism to pass crticisim on Israel
It's NOT anti-semtisim to ask Israel to stop settlements.

The problem is that you are all VERY aggressive about this issue, even though it's scale is much smaller than other issues that you were all pretty much silent about, and most of you can't even explain why you are pro-Palestine 

To elaborate, on every single post from the pro-Palestine side, there are people in the comments from either Israels side, or people who are relatively neutral engaging. Agreeing, disagreeing, and explaining why.

On the other hand, on pro-israeli/anti-hamas/posts crticising pro-palestinians, there are barely any pro-palestiniand engaing with the arguements being made. Those who do engage, usually make points that were already countered in the post, and then don't respond when the person who made the post or other people responding to them.

The problem isn't that you're crticising Israel, it's that you are biased against it, and can't explain why you're right.

A concrete example:
The genocide arguement. You are all justfying everything you say, by saying Israel is commiting genocide. 

Yet for some reason, on posts explaining why it isn't a genocide, I haven't seen a single person manage to actually refute what the posts are saying, but rather some people saying ""yes it is"".

If you want I'll add images of the specific messages I'm talking about

EDIT: So many of you immediately started saying I'm upset that people are a little aggressive while Israel is committing genocide. Thank you for demonstrating exactly what I'm talking about. Before you continue with those comments, check out [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/17peao4/lets_do_some_genocide_math/) post, which explains why it's completely absurd to call this a genocide",Special-Quantity-469,t2_7h8biuu7,0.67,94,805
983,175k5dl,2023-10-11,IsraelPalestine,Pro-Palestine-Not Anymore,"As a Lebanese/Syrian, I always thought Israel's initial nabka was wrong, forcing people to flee is wrong. I obviously don't think that the Jews should have stayed stateless especially after WWII, but it's so hypocritical considering how Palestinians are stateless. In the town where I'm from overseas, 80% of the students had displaced parents. The Arab states messed up by not offering true citizenship to these folk for no other reason than pride, so everyone is to blame there, but it always rubbed me the wrong way how the Jewish state was so emphasized to help those who are stateless, but Arab states can be invaded without real substantial claim and displace millions of people who end up with no state. Forget America, look at the Kurds, Assyrians, or any other minority in the middle-east, they've been persecuted, beheaded, raped adnosium but the media doesn't shed light on it. Even if the media did care, the first political move would be to add sanctions to the country and just make the entire nation suffer regardless of ethnicity or religion. I think as a kid, seeing birthright trips offered to students that are sometimes subsidized by our taxes, go to a country that only existed in the modern history, post WWII that's flourishing mostly because of our tax dollars, rubbed me the wrong way, especially as an Armenian who's great grandmother survived the Armenian genocide. It wouldn't have bothered me as much if I didn't know that Israeli zionists continue to add settlements outside the scope of international recognition and continue to treat Arabs as second class citizens. It just feels icky.  
However, I never liked Hamas. Ever. I always hated that that religion was brought into this discussion because my family and most of my friends are Christian and the zionist Israelis treat us all the same negative way. However, as much as that argument still stands, the extreme muslims have not made it a safe space for any other minority, woman, Christian, athiest, Jew, etc. It's so disgusting that as much as I want to be pro-Palestine, I find myself shuddering, even before these current events, at the leaders who probably believe in the most sexist sh\*\*. I know there are Palestinian woman historians, scholars, lawyers, all with more intellect than the top 1% of the population, but the people would never elect them to actually lead, especially in Gaza. Israel's occupation is much to blame on the slow progression of Palesintian rights, it's like wondering why black people in the US are still not socially elite members of society. But at some point enough is enough. Seeing the women being paraded around was enough. What did they think would come of that? That the world would finally say, ""See! they're doing this because of all the people they've killed on our side! We have to rape and parade their women! Now the world will know not to mess with us and maybe look into our situation and help us kick them out."" Like what on earth in the caveman mindset have Hamas come to? I always thought it was dumb seeing people call Hamas terrorists and not just a military operation, that was when they were accused of  bombing Israeli towns. Now this is an act of serious emotional terorissm, they've invoked something int he hearts and minds of people around the world to incentivize their own demise and it depresses me. The women and children don't deserve this. These Palestinian people's grandfathers, great grandfathers are all looking down on them in shame, this is not a fight this is dehumanization. And to everyone telling me that the Palestinians have been dehumanized, yes they have they have been put into cages, killed, tortured, etc. If anyone can point to women being paraded around after being raped, women who have not asked to be a part of the war, that were just in their pajamas cooking something for their family, please let me know, and even then 2 wrongs don't make a right.  
If the descendants of the Potowatomi tribe started fighting Americans again, America would fight back, and I would think of it as a war that was somewhat justly started given the colonial history. If the Native Americans started stealing women and raping them and parading them, I'd want the US to obliterate them. I'm sorry, that's obviously an exaggerated response, but that's not something I'd ever align myself with, I'm a woman, I have sisters, I have been discriminated against being a minority, but I'd rather feel safe as a woman, save from sexual violations of my body, safe from male perversion. I'm not pro Israel, I'm not pro Palestine. I'm pro humanity. As generic and hippie as that sounds I just am. I cannot condemn one without the other, I cannot support one without the other. I strongly believe that everyone deserves a state that recognizes the status of their intangible vulnerable characteristic, ethnicity/religion. There are so many groups that don't have that the Bahai, Zoro-Astrians, Kurds, etc. I think that the establishment of Israel is unprecedented and was frankly not necessary considering the western worlds reputation with them has been going very well, and now everyone thinks they are entitled to their own nationalist somewhat theocrratic state that will for sure breed racism to the non majority ethnicity. I think the goal moving forward is just to create an egalitarian society that doesn't emphasize ethnicity or religion.",sweetsiren77,t2_91ph73bkc,0.78,91,151

985,13k2tye,2023-05-17,IsraelPalestine,Nakba Day should not be recognized in democratic countries,"I have a major problem with the worldwide push to recognize the new ""Nakba Day.""

There are facts, and then there is the narrative created around those facts.

The facts are that \~750,000 Arab Palestinians fled what is now Israel during the 1948 war. Nobody disputes that fact. However, that's where the consensus ends. The narrative spun around the events by the Palestinian propaganda is that all 750,000 were forced out by the Zionists in an ethnic cleanse to create the State of Israel. The facts simply don't support this narrative. Let's look at those facts:

1. The Arab world rejected UN Resolution 181 to partition Palestine into Jewish and Palestinian states. The rest of the international community voted in favour of the Resolution.
2. Arab leaders made it known that they would prevent the creation of the Jewish state by any means necessary.
3. Immediately following the adoption of UN Resolution 181 in 1947, civil war broke out in Palestine - started when Arab militants attacked a bus and killed seven Jews.
4. The Arab League carried out its threat and invaded Israel immediately after it declared independence in 1948.
5. It was during this period in 1947-1948 that 750,000 Arab Palestinians fled. Some proportion fled in fear, and some were encouraged to leave by Arab Leaders on the promise that they would be able to return in a few days after they crushed the Israeli military and destroyed Israel. There is documented proof of this.
6. Some proportion of the 750,000 were forced to flee by the Israeli forces. There is no consensus on what the size of that group was, but some estimates put it at 150,000-250,000.

Those are the historical facts as we know them. Based on these facts, it is simply false to assert that the Nakba represents the ethnic cleansing of 750,000 Palestinians by Israel. The Nakba was the consequence of a failed attempted genocide by the Arab world, and a failed attempt to destroy a newly independent democratic country. It simply should not be recognized in any democratic country in a way that is consistent with the Palestinian narrative of events.",Darth_Jonathan,t2_lieh7o5l,0.73,88,288

AND STLL the German people denied they existed not all there were small rebellions in Germany many attempts on Hitlers life. But the majority did not believe they existed. Even after the fall of Berlin, the issue of holocaust denialism  was so bad they had to be forced to visit the camps and a law was passed that it was illegal to deny that the holocaust happened and that law was needed to be passed 30 years later.

987,10ru9pq,2023-02-02,IsraelPalestine,Why is the flag of Palestine often flown at protests that have nothing to do with Palestine?,"Yesterday, here in London, there was a march in support of teacher strikes and a pay rise for teachers. This is a cause I support wholeheartedly! But I keep wondering about something. I noticed some of the marchers waving large Palestinian flags. Now, to be clear, the Palestinian flag in itself is nothing bad. I would never feel uncomfortable if I see one in Israel/Palestine, or in a Palestinian restaurant or home, for example, because I know then that it’s being used by Palestinians to celebrate their culture and identity, and that’s valid and something that makes sense to me. But seeing these flags at the education protest yesterday did make me feel uncomfortable, because I couldn’t understand the equivalence. What does a tiny country far away have to do with funding for education in the UK? 

And this isn’t the only example. I’ve seen Palestinian flags flown at rallies for all kinds of things that have nothing to do with Palestine or the conflict. Gun control protests (despite Israel having surprisingly stringent gun control measures in place), pro-democracy protests (despite Israel having election after election after election), climate justice protests (despite Israel being one of the countries leading the way in environmental sustainability). And listen, I’m not blind to the fact that Israel has done bad things, nor am I suggesting that supporting Palestine, or flying their flag, is a bad thing either. On the contrary, I believe in supporting human rights and calling out injustice wherever it happens, including in Palestine. I just don’t like false equivalencies. 

There are cultural and land-based conflicts and systems of oppression happening all over the world - but I have personally never seen people using Hong Kong or Somaliland or Taiwanese or Armenian or Cypriot or Syrian flags as symbols of every random progressive cause you could think of. It’s always Palestinian flags, and it seems that the people waving them (at least here in the UK) are almost never actually Palestinian. 

I’ve been trying to analyse why the flags flown in these contexts made me feel uncomfortable, and I realise it’s because when you fly these flags at protests in a different country, in support of a different issue, it’s like you’re holding Israel responsible for the whole world’s ills. It’s like the I/P conflict is being cut-and-pasted onto every single other issue in the world, with Palestine representing every progressive cause and Israel representing the obstacle towards achieving it. As if Israel is the reason teachers are underpaid and overworked in the UK, as if Israel is the reason international corporations are polluting our planet, as if Israel is responsible for mass shootings in American schools. And the fact that this seems to happen *only* in relation to this conflict and not the dozens of others… maybe I’m misguided here, but I can’t get myself to believe that this pattern of holding the world’s one and only Jewish country as responsible for every problem everywhere on earth is not just another manifestation of the “Jews running the world/causing all the world’s problems” trope that we’ve been seeing different iterations of over and over again for hundreds of years. I cannot think of any other explanation for why the Palestinian flag is being co-opted for these random international causes. 

But maybe I’m missing something. I’m interested in hearing if others have observed the same thing, and what you think about it. If you’re Jewish or Israeli, how does it make you feel when you see the Palestinian flag flown at unrelated marches and rallies? If you’re Palestinian, what do you make of non-Palestinians using your flag as a symbol for causes that have nothing to do with you? I don’t want to argue, I want to learn and understand.

*Personal Thoughts:*
(not for everyone, feel free to skip)


For the longest time, I struggled with my identity.


A Palestinian kid born inside Israel. Like…wtf.


Many of my friends refuse to this day to say the word ""Israel"" and call themselves ""Palestinian"" only.


But since I was 12, that did not make sense to me.


So l decided to mix the two and become a ""Palestinian-Israeli""


I thought this term reflected who I was.
Palestinian first. Israeli second.


But after recent events, I started to think.

And think.

And think.

And then my thoughts turned to anger.


I realized that if Israel were to be ""invaded"" like that again, we would not be safe. To a terrorist invading Israel, all citizens are targets.


900 Israelis died so far. More than 40 of them are Arabs. Killed by other Arabs. And even 2 Thai people died too.


And I do not want to live under a Palestinian government.


Which means I only have one home, even if I'm not Jewish:


Israel.


That's where all my family lives. That's where I grew up. That's the country I want to see continue to exist so I can exist.


Palestine should exist too as an independent state. And I hope to see the country thrive and become less extreme and more prosperous.


But it's not my home.


So from today forward,


I view myself as an ""Israeli-Palestinian"".
Israeli first.


Palestinian second.


Sometimes it takes a shock like this to see so clearly.

From my understanding, in 1947, the UN came up with a partition plan to split Mandate Palestine into two states: Israel and Palestine. 

Isreal accepted the deal, Palestine didn't and launched an attack on Israel and involved their Arab neighbours and got their butts kicked. 

The war involved: 

Israel: c. 10,000 initially, rising to 115,000 by March 1949

Arabs: c. 2,000 initially, rising to 70,000, of which: Egypt: 10,000 initially, rising to 20,000
Iraq: 3,000 initially, rising to 15,000–18,000
Syria: 2,500–5,000
Transjordan: 8,000 – 12,000
Lebanon: 1,000[7]
Saudi Arabia: 800–1,200
Arab Liberation Army (ex Nazis): 3,500–6,000

After the war, Israel kicked out 700,000 Palestinians and they fled to neighbouring Egypt, Lebanon and Jordan.

In 70 CE, their civilization was again destroyed by Rome. Rome took many Jewish prisoners as slaves back to the homeland and to Iberia, where they founded the first Ashkenazi (European diaspora) and Sephardi (Iberian diaspora) communities. Ashkenazim would generally migrate north to the Rhine region and then east toward Poland and Russia. Sephardim would be removed from Iberia by the 1492 Alhambra Decree, dispersed to North Africa and Turkey.

For 1000 years after the Roman conquest Israel remained a center for Jewish life and population. Israel- renamed Palestine by the Romans- remained a majority Jewish region for centuries. Several unsuccessful military campaigns were waged to liberate Israel- the 115 Kitos War, the 132 Bar Kochba Revolt, the 350 Gallus Revolt, the 380 Himyarite Campaign, and the 602 Heraclius Revolt to name a few.

The Jewish population of Israel hit its nadir after the First Crusade. Immediately, Jewish leaders around the world began moving to and/or encouraging followers to move to Israel, especially after expulsions from England (1290), France (1391), Austria (1491), and Spain (1492). After 1492, israel, specifically Tzfat, again became a center for Jewish life and culture. In the coming generations, especially with the rise of Hassidism, Aliyah increase tremendously. Even more so after the pogroms and mass antisemitism in the Russian Empire in the 17th and 18th centuries.

In the late 18th century, Ashkenazi Jews began to employ the new tools of European nationalism and colonialism to achieve their goal of returning to their land and rebuilding their state (Zionism), which eventually proved successful.

Throughout the diaspora, the exiles of Israel maintained a common national and cultural identity, a portable version of their Israelite civilization which they called Judaism, and a will to again come home and rebuild what they had lost.

For someone who doesn’t know anything about this conflict it would look horrific. Do you want to stop the violence?

Let’s say you do. Then that would mean Hamas can’t be in power anymore. Hamas commits horrible atrocities against anyone basically, but mostly Israeli people. Israel cannot just let Hamas do that, so they fight them, but the problem is that Hamas is taking advantage of you the civilians. You can’t expect the violence to stop when your leaders are psychopathic terrorists who only care about violence. But wait a minute you the civilians elected them to be in power in the first place, and I’m not seeing you trying to take them out of power. So maybe you don’t really want to stop the violence? So is your goal the same as Hamas’s goal? Do you want to “free Palestine” aka banishing or slaughtering every single Israeli person to conquer Israel?

Again, let’s say that’s actually your purpose. Well now you wouldn’t look so innocent to the world would you. That goal will create more violence and chaos in the world in general. It would literally mean WW3, because there is no way the world would be silent for exterminating an entire country.

1002,17oqa46,2023-11-06,IsraelPalestine,How UNRWA repeatedly changed the definition of refugee to accommodate Palestinians,"Here's a [summary](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/08/17/unrwa-has-changed-the-definition-of-refugee/) from the Foreign Policy magazine ([non-paywalled link](https://archive.ph/CLH8w)).

> UNRWA was founded in 1949 through U.N. General Assembly Resolution 302 at the conclusion of the Arab-Israeli conflict of 1948 

> The agency defines Palestinian refugees as “persons whose normal place of residence was Palestine during the period 1 June 1946 to 15 May 1948, and who lost both home and means of livelihood as a result of the 1948 conflict.”

> In 1965, UNRWA changed the eligibility requirements to be a Palestinian refugee to include third-generation descendants, and in 1982, it extended it again, to include all descendants of Palestine refugee males, including legally adopted children, regardless of whether they had been granted citizenship elsewhere. This classification process is inconsistent with how all other refugees in the world are classified, including the definition used by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the laws concerning refugees in the United States.

> The only refugees who do not fall under the UNHCR and instead have their own agency are the Palestinians. While the UNHCR has resettled millions of refugees, since the time it was created, UNRWA has not managed to solve or even diminish the problem at all. Instead, using its own metrics, the number of refugees has grown exponentially, while UNRWA has become one of the larger U.N. agencies, with 30,000 personnel and a $1.2 billion budget. This is despite the fact that many of the UNRWA “refugees” are not actually refugees at all under the standard international definition of that term. For example, of the 2 million Palestinian refugees in Jordan, most have been granted Jordanian citizenship.

By contrast, all of 850K Mizrahi Jewish refugees, expelled from the Arab states, have since been integrated in Israel or elsewhere. Overall, over 50M people got displaced during the formation of modern states in the last 75 years. This includes 20M people moved between Pakistan/India in 1947, or 15M Sudeten Germans, or the 1.5M people displaced during the Armenian-Azeri wars. They have all largely settled in their new countries of residence, and none of them have the right of return.

Here's what Alexander Galloway, then the director of UNRWA in Jordan, had to say about Palestinian refugees in 1952:

> It is perfectly clear that Arab nations do not want to solve the Arab refugee problem. They want to keep it as an open sore, as an affront against the United Nations and as a weapon against Israel. Arab leaders don’t give a damn whether the refugees live or die.

And it seems to be indeed the case. For instance, the Arab League passed the Resolution 1547 in 1959, explicitly instructing its members not to give Palestinians citizenship, in order to “avoid dissolution of their identity and protect their rights to return to their homeland”. So although many Palestinians have lived there for centuries, they are denied integration in order to put additional pressure on Israel. The only country that has naturalised a significant number of Palestinians is Jordan, the majority of whose population is currently Palestinian. However, even Jordan revoked its citizenship from all Palestinians residing in the West Bank in 1990-2010.

If UNRWA understood the cause as early as 1952, why hasn't it done anything to actually solve the problem, instead of indefinitely perpetuating it, at a bloating expense to U.N. funders, such as the USA?",OmOshIroIdEs,t2_4yj0q2gd,0.85,74,161

So clearly the best way to be done with this ASAP is to have Hamas surrender. No more Israelis or Palestinians die, the hostages are returned, Palestine can elect a real government, and the world can help them heal so that another Hamas never rises to power.

So for the people protesting for a cease fire... I mean I agree. It's the best way to minimize deaths and to push forward for peace in the future.

But it must be Hamas surrending that initiates the ceasefire, right? Otherwise Hamas just stays in power and continues to torture Israelis and as a byproduct Palestinians as well.

I know this sounds like a pipedream, but I just don't see why we're not seeing this message from the Pro-Palestine protests.

1005,13xgrpo,2023-06-01,IsraelPalestine,Its impossible to reason with pro-Palestine supporters because their positions arent based on reason,"I have been observing pro-Palestinians in action for over a decade and I have come to the conclusion that it is impossible to reason with them or change their minds through reason. Their positions are based on emotion and the inherent belief that Palestine is always right. It is not based on things like principles or adherence to any kind of consistent standard. My evidence for this, besides observing them in action both here and on r/Israel_Palestine, on other subreddits and Twitter of course, is just to look at their own policy positions, many of which are self-contradictory and nonsensical. I have been lampooning this in my “a conversation about” posts but since it seems like some people cannot understand the satire or are in denial about the points with their constant claims of 'strawman!' let me make it a little clearer.

Here are just a few of the key beliefs held by pro-Palestinian people, or are expected to believe in order to remain “pro-Palestinian” and welcome in the movement:

- Israel is inherently discriminatory against non-Jews, and is an “ethnostate,” because it’s a Jewish state, while Palestine is neither despite being an Arab and Muslim state. Similarly, Zionism is racism but Palestinian/Arab nationalism is not, and neither is any other kind of national liberation movement like Catalonian or Scottish independence. No Arab or Muslim or any other kind of nation state are ethnostates/racist/apartheid etc. or even worth discussing.

- Israel’s existence is fundamentally flawed because it was created “at the expense” of Palestinians, but Palestine’s right to exist is unquestionable even though at this point tens of thousands of people have been murdered in its name.

- Anything Israel does to defend itself from terrorism is “collective punishment” and ""oppression"" if it so much as inconveniences a Palestinian, but every Israeli and indeed every “Zionist” is a legitimate target for Palestinian and/or pro-Palestinian violence and/or boycotts.

- Even the most vicious terrorists like Samir Kuntar and Rasmea Odeh are human beings and have human rights, and therefore must be treated with kid gloves, but any Israeli who sets foot in the West Bank is a ""settler"" and thus deserves to die.

- Palestinian women and children are always innocent, even when they are committing a terrorist attack, but the killing of Shalhevet Pas and the Itamar Massacre were “legitimate resistance to occupation.”

- International law is the most important thing ever, and is sacrosanct, when it comes to Israel following it, but when Palestinians murder children the party line is “international law? What’s that? Never heard of it! You can't expect Palestinians to follow international law!” and ""Palestinians have the right to resist the occupation by any means necessary.""

- Similarly, it’s fine for Palestine to break international law and not respect human rights because Palestine isn’t a democracy and Israel is. Also, Israel isn’t a democracy but rather an apartheid racist ethnocracy, while Palestine isn’t…for some reason.

- No Palestinian is responsible for anything the Palestinian government does, but every Israeli and indeed every Zionist is responsible for everything the Israeli government does and deserves to be treated accordingly. In fact, no one represents Palestine, not Fatah, not Hamas, no one. Actually, Palestine doesn't even exist, except when it serves the arguments of pro-Palestinians.

- Zionism is racism, Israel exists on stolen Palestinian land, and anyone who even recognizes Israel’s existence, let alone tries to negotiate with it, is a traitor. Also Israel is the reason there isn't peace and Israel is the one who doesn't want peace. 

- If any Palestinian terrorist is killed for any reason, it’s murder. If the terrorist is killed in the middle of committing a terrorist attack, it’s a “state sponsored execution.” If the IDF arrests the terrorist after the fact, it’s an “invasion” of a Palestinian town by “death squads.” Meanwhile, of course, every person in Israel (or even outside of Israel) is a legitimate target for “resistance.”

- What the Palestinians are experiencing is worse than the Holocaust, but they won’t accept any peace deals that are “unfair” or “unjust"" like only 98% of the West Bank. 

- Jews and Israel are totally separate things and shouldn’t be perceived as synonymous, or else anti-Zionism would be anti-Semitism, but it’s okay to harass Jews on the assumption that they are pro-Israel and to use Jew-baiting language like ""Never again doesn't apply to Israelis"".

- Israel killing civilians unintentionally is a thousand times worse than Palestine killing civilians intentionally, regardless of what international law says.

- Palestinian and Arab attempts to wipe out Israel through war is perfectly acceptable but Israel is “genociding” and “erasing” the Palestinians by building settlements and using checkpoints.

- Extremist statements by Israeli politicians prove the Israeli population are extremist and radical, Palestinian politicians making extremist statements don't matter in the slightest and don't represent anyone other than themselves.

- Similarly, eight Israelis sitting in lawn chairs watching the IDF defend them proves all Israelis are racists who revel in the deaths of Palestinians. Meanwhile Palestinians dancing in celebration of a terrorist attack doesn't indicate anything, they are all just individuals.

- Palestinians wanting to come back to their homeland is a perfectly justified cause worth pursuing at any cost, even if that cost is tens of thousands of lives. Jews wanting to come back to their homeland is settler colonialism.

- Putting any restrictions on Muslim activity on the Temple Mount for any reason is oppression. Banning Jews from praying on the Temple Mount is perfectly fine.

- A Jew who doesn’t like Israel is a hero and a ""real Jew,"" an Arab or Muslim who disagrees with Palestine even a little bit is a traitor. Also Zionists won’t allow any dissent within their community.

- Jews lobbying the US government to help Israel are fifth columnists and traitors, Arabs who lobby the US government to help Palestine are exercising their democratic rights and standing up for what's right.
 
-Israel turning down the Arab Peace Initiative proves they don't want peace, but Palestine turning down every peace offer they've ever received and refusing to make one of their own doesn't prove anything.

- Israel building settlements proves they care more about land than peace, but Palestine refusing to negotiate until Israel stops building settlements doesn't prove anything.

- Anywhere an Arab lives is ""Arab land"" for the rest of time, whether he actually owns it or not. If a Jew lives there, it's ""stolen Arab land."" Palestine is an Arab country because Arabs live there. Israel is stolen Arab land, even though Jews live there.

- ""Palestine will be free from the river to the sea,"" ""Zionism is racism,"" ""the best solution is for the Jews to go back to Poland and Russia,"" but it is somehow Israel who poses an existential threat to Palestine and it's Palestinians whose ""existence is resistance.""

Naturally this doesn’t include the many lies swallowed unconditionally and repeated unironically by pro-Palestinians that are absurdly untrue, such as “the Jews are treating the Palestinians like the Nazis treated them,” the common belief a ""one state solution"" will somehow magically lead to peace and human rights for everyone instead of ethnic cleansing and civil war like it has every time it's been attempted in the past, or the tendency of pro-Palestinians to be proven wrong and then come back two days later repeating the same lies. And of course, let’s not forget the most frustrating contradiction of all:

- If the pro-Palestinian you are talking to at this exact moment doesn’t personally believe any of the above talking points or contradictions, or claims not to believe them, then the talking points don’t exist and they shouldn't be talked about. [See the recent thread about ""from the river to the sea"" for examples of this mentality in action.](https://np.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/13up862/from_the_river_to_the_sea_palestine_will_be_free/)

With all this in mind, someone please explain to me what's the value in having a conversation with pro-Palestine supporters. It’s become clear to me that their positions are not derived from an understanding of facts or from any kind of consistent moral principles. Rather, they start with a conclusion first, namely that Israel is in the wrong and Palestine is in the right, and work their way backwards from there. It is no wonder therefore that their movement hasn’t succeeded and at this rate probably never will. When there's no actual consistency or principles, how can there be any kind of consensus or common understanding? How can one reason with people whose positions are not based on reason? It seems impossible. But what do you think? Is there any hope of breaking through and reaching them on a logical level, or are we all cursed to repeat the same talking points at each other until the end of time?

1006,14a2fey,2023-06-15,IsraelPalestine,The Palestinian Center for Survey and Research's Latest Poll Brings the Truth about what Palestinian,"Something I’ve noticed with online discussions about Israel and Palestine is that the online commentators who support the Palestinians frequently make claims about what the Palestinians want and believe that are truly baseless and worlds away from reality. That is why I’m so grateful for resources like the Palestinian Center for Survey and Research, which is a Palestinian group (so it can’t be smeared as ‘Zionist’) that conducts comprehensive polls of Palestinians with correct methodology so their results cannot be denied. [The latest poll has come out](https://www.pcpsr.org/en/node/940), and like always, it stands in stark contrast with what the online narratives of Palestinian belief are. Let’s take a look, eh?

> On the occasion of **the Nakba, the overwhelming majority places the blame for it** on non-Palestinian parties while only 7% believe that the weakness of the Palestinian people is primarily responsible. **The ""weak and conspiratorial Arab role"" comes first with 38%, followed by the British Mandate with 36%,** and Zionist organizations and movements with 16%.

What an amazing finding this is! The Nakba, Israel’s original sin, the ultimate evil that anti-Zionists use to justify everything they say and believe, only 16% of Palestinians blame “the Zionists” for it! This is incredible, I’ve never seen anything like this before. Instead, the vast majority of Palestinians blame the Arab states and the British Mandate. Of course, they don’t take responsibility for it themselves, despite starting the war, but we can’t ask for miracles. This survey is starting off fantastic, I’m loving this.

> **When asked what has been the most positive or the best thing that has happened to the Palestinian people since the Nakba,** the largest percentage (24%) said that it was the establishment of Islamic movements, such as Hamas and Islamic Jihad and their participation in armed struggle; 21% said that it was the eruption of the first and second intifada; 18% said the establishment of the PLO; 14% said the establishment of the PA in the mid-nineties, and 9% said it was the establishment of Fateh in the sixties and the launch of the armed struggle. 

What’s the best thing that’s happened to the Palestinian people since the Nakba? Well, not the establishment of their own government system that’s recognized by hundreds of countries and the UN and the international legitimacy, relative self-governance, and respectability that comes with it. No way, only 18% of Palestinians think that. Instead, the vast majority say the existence of terror groups that kill Jews. Hamas, Islamic Jihad, the PLO, Fatah, take your pick! Bottom line, Palestinians think these groups are the best things that have happened to them. Wow. Just wow.

> 71% of the public (79% in the Gaza Strip and 66% in the West Bank) say they are in favor of forming armed groups such as the “Lions’ Den” and the “Jenin Battalion,” which do not take orders from the PA and are not part of the PA security services; 23% are against that. 80% say they are against the surrender of the armed groups’ members and their arms to the PA in order to receive protection against Israeli assassination; 16% say they are for it. The vast majority (86%) says the PA does not have the right to arrest member of these armed groups in order to prevent them from carrying out attacks against Israel or to provide them with protection; only 11% say they favor it.

The vast majority of Palestinians continue to support rogue armed terrorist groups that kill Jews and answer to no one and they oppose the PA arresting members of those groups. That’s not surprising, polls have indicated that for quite some time, but it’s still interesting.

The entire poll is fascinating, but this is already long, so let’s conclude with this:

> Support for the concept of the two-state solution stands at 28% and opposition stands at 70%. 

> Reflecting on the latest UN speech of president Abbas in which he described the situation on the ground in the West Bank as “apartheid” and that the Palestinian people will demand equal rights in one state for two peoples, 21% say that they are in favor of such one state solution while 76% expressed opposition. Three months ago, support for Abbas’ position on the one-state solution stood at 22%.

70%+ of Palestinians oppose BOTH the two-state solution and a one-state solution with equal rights for two peoples. It doesn’t take a genius to figure out then what they do want, but I’ll spell it out anyway: An Arab Muslim state of Palestine from the river to the sea that’s for the Palestinian people only.

1007,11yizds,2023-03-22,IsraelPalestine,France24 Suspends Journalists for Anti-Israel Rhetoric,"In the news from the last week, [France24, a mainstream Western news outlet,](https://www.timesofisrael.com/france-24-tv-network-suspends-4-journalists-for-alleged-anti-israel-vitriol/) suspended four journalists for “allegedly anti-Israel statements.” Three of whom worked for the Arabic language version, which is probably how they were able to get away with their rhetoric for so long. 

According to Middle East Monitor, one of the journalists, Laila Odeh, was fired for “pro-Palestine rhetoric.” What rhetoric? According to MEM, it was “using the term ""martyr"" in reference to Palestinians killed by Israel and ""1948 lands"" when referring to the land of Palestine under the British Mandate before Israel's establishment.”

But [according to CAMERA](https://www.camera.org/article/the-antisemitic-social-media-divas-of-france24-arabic/), the pro-Israel NGO that exposed the journalists, the rhetoric was a bit worse than that. 

> she consistently glorifies “martyrs” who targeted and killed civilians, and refers to the terrorists’ deaths as “martyrdom.” She has applied this laudatory designation to Hamas– and PIJ-affiliated Muhammad ‘Asi, who planted a bomb on a Tel Aviv bus in November 2012, wounding 28 civilians (he “ascended to the highest heavens,” she marveled);...About terrorist Muhammad Tareq Yous, who stabbed to death Yotam Ovadia, 31, a father of two infants, she praised: “Death of one of the settlers in the stabbing operation in the settlement of Adam, carried out by a Palestinian who was martyred after getting shot.”

> With no filter, the transparent Odeh freely shared: Because I am a Palestinian refugee, I demand of the Arab League to arm me so that I retrieve my land which Israel has unlawfully occupied. And because I am a sister of a martyr, I demand of the Arab League to arm me so that I retrieve the body of my martyr brother 

Here’s some selections from the other journalists that were fired, feel free to check out the link above for the rest.

> Maroun [one of the suspended journalists] has lamented Hitler’s present-day absence, tweeting, for instance, “Rise, sir Hitler, rise, there are a few people that need to be burned.” Maroun also liked the following comment post to her tweet: “He should have been cloned for a time of need.”...Any plain day will do: “July refuses to let go! #I_hate_you,_you_Jew.” (Screen capture at left). And apropos absolutely nothing in particular, she tweeted: “If only Hitler was Lebanese.”

> It seems that even calling “Israel” by its name takes special effort for Abi-Saab [one of the suspended journalists]. In December 2013, more than two years before she started working for France24, she wrote on Facebook: “It might happen in the future that I will have to #apologize to Israel, since from now until death its name will remain Palestine from the river to the sea, and the names of villages and cities will stay Palestinian, and I haven’t stopped hoping it [Israel] is to be annihilated – this status is for safekeeping.”

> He [Sharif Bibi, one of the suspended journalists] tweeted: “Hear ye – hear ye – hear ye – from the see of the martyrs’ blood – from the effort of the red revolutionaries – we shall eradicate you, Israel, from your [very] roots.”

So, some questions arise from this news story. 

If these are the kind of people working in Western news outlets covering the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, how reliable is that news coverage? How likely is it that the reporters’ views are influencing their reporting? 

Is it acceptable for reporters to hold pro-terrorism and pro-murder (or as pro-Palestine people would say, pro-resistance to occupation) views and still be employed as reporters? It seems like impartiality is less and less of a value in media these days, but it still seems like that kind of belief is a bridge too far. 

Is saying things like “Rise Hitler rise” “pro-Palestinian” rhetoric? What does that say about Palestine if it is?",TracingBullets,t2_w8btvkv3,0.87,71,217

This is somewhat of an 'own goal' for the Palestinians as it not only underlines the complete lack of any archeological record of their ancestral presence in the area prior to the Muslim era (and in fact at the time this spoon was made the Holy Land was almost certainly under Jewish rule) but it also adds to the recent spate of cultural and historical appropriation of Jewish historical figures, places and events in the land of Israel by the Palestinians. These include claiming that Jesus was a Palestinian (he was a Jew born in Judea, around 250 years before it was renamed Palestine by the Romans), and only a few days ago the Palestinian minister of Culture called the Western Wall, Judaism's holiest site,  a Muslim holy place and Netanyahu's visit there as a "" Jewish storming"" of this site.

1010,129viy2,2023-04-02,IsraelPalestine,"What Hamas wants, and why their weapons must be restricted","I have often seen people in this subreddit spreading misinformation about the ideology of Hamas, specifically as it relates to the blockade of Gaza. So, I am making this post to refer back to, next time it comes up. 

Many pro-Palestinian people say that Hamas is fighting to free itself from Israel's blockade, and they just want to have a free country of their own. They will cite articles such as this one, which says in the headline that Hamas accepts a two-state solution: 

[https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/5/2/hamas-accepts-palestinian-state-with-1967-borders](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/5/2/hamas-accepts-palestinian-state-with-1967-borders)

This article mentions that the original founding charter of Hamas, from 1988, has been replaced by a more moderate document in 2017. It is true that the updated document is more moderate, but only relative to the 1988 one, which is a low bar for improvement. It is still extremist, and to claim that they will accept a two-state solution is not correct. Here we will examine what the document actually says. They explain their ideology clearly. 

The false belief that Hamas would accept a two-state solution comes from this part of their updated charter:

>However, **without compromising its rejection of the Zionist entity and without relinquishing any Palestinian rights,** Hamas considers the establishment of a fully sovereign and independent Palestinian state, with Jerusalem as its capital along the lines of the 4th of June 1967, with the return of the refugees and the displaced to their homes from which they were expelled, to be a formula of national consensus. 

The part in bold is usually ignored, and people only focus on the part which comes after it. 

They are basically saying, they will be willing to accept more land from Israel along 1967 borders, and the end of the blockade, and the ""right of return."" But they are clearly not offering peace in return. So what is even the point, from Israel's perspective? They could be given more land, and the blockade could be ended, just so they could then continue to attack Israel with more advanced weapons. It is totally one-sided. 

Here is some elaboration on their ideology, which leaves no doubt that they do in fact want to eventually conquer all of Israel's land:

>The establishment of “Israel” is entirely illegal  
>  
>There shall be no recognition of the legitimacy of the Zionist entity. Whatever has befallen the land of Palestine in terms of occupation, settlement building, judaisation or changes to its features or falsification of facts is illegitimate. Rights never lapse.   
>  
>Hamas believes that no part of the land of Palestine shall be compromised or conceded, irrespective of the causes, the circumstances and the pressures and no matter how long the occupation lasts. Hamas rejects any alternative to the full and complete liberation of Palestine, from the river to the sea.   
>  
>Resistance and jihad for the liberation of Palestine will remain a legitimate right, a duty and an honour for all the sons and daughters of our people and our Ummah.   
>  
>Resisting the occupation with all means and methods is a legitimate right guaranteed by divine laws and by international norms and laws. At the heart of these lies armed resistance, which is regarded as the strategic choice for protecting the principles and the rights of the Palestinian people. 

In case anyone thinks that ""Palestine"" = just West Bank + Gaza to them, it doesn't. They use the term to refer to all of Israel, as they clarify here:

>Palestine, which extends from the River Jordan in the east to the Mediterranean in the west and from Ras al-Naqurah in the north to Umm al-Rashrash in the south, is an integral territorial unit.  

Another counter-argument is that Hamas does not actually have the ability to take Israel's land; they would never win a war. This is correct, and I am not actually worried about them taking all of Israel. However, they are still stupid enough to try, and they can still kill people and cause a lot of problems in their attempts to do so. 

To summarize, Hamas is a group of religious extremists who state that they want to take all of Israel's land for an Islamic state, and they believe in using ""armed resistance"" to achieve this goal. For safety, it is best to limit their weapons as much as possible, which is why a blockade is needed. Hamas is not fighting to end the blockade, they are fighting to take over Israel, so ending the blockade is not going to appease them.",JosephL_55,t2_6hf692be,0.91,69,151

No.

It’s so infuriating how bigots try to infiltrate the #FreePalestine movement as a way to spread their hatred. Things like this are how history continues to repeat itself. As a matter of fact, both regular Muslims & Jews have been publicly condemning their regimes for their actions during this conflict because of how they’ve handled things & the amount of lives that've been / continue to be lost / ruined. Nobody should be branded or gaslight into believing that simply criticising the actions of one's country's government makes you a bad person.

They disguise themselves in ambulances and other trucks as well. Their leader tells people to stay in these areas as human shields. If Hamas is not exterminated they will come back to Israel. IDF does not bomb these places to kill citizens. hamas makes the space so personal that it would be suicide to attempt to go at them in a small range and would cause casualties regardless. israel tries to do everything it can but has to eliminate Hamas to prevent Oct 7.

We have seen multiple rallies / protests where chants of directly anti-semitic beliefs echo through the crowd. But I never see anyone from the pro-palestine side addressing this.

He threatened to rape, kill, and commit genocide (by saying he wants a way to stop jewish women from giving birth) against jewish people. None of his actions can ever be interpreted as any form of ""resistance"". He, and his threats have no relationship to Israel.

Before I continue though, I’d like to write a joke, a quote and a point that are important in context.

**The joke**:

A Russian and an American are arguing. The American says “we have freedom of speech in my country that you don’t: we can criticise our president!”.

The Russian says “if that’s your metric, then we too have freedom of speech in our country. More than in yours too, because we can criticise your president even more than you can!”

**The quote**:

“The amount of violations of human rights in a country is always an inverse function of the amount of complaints about human rights violations heard from there. The greater the number of complaints being aired, the better protected are human rights in that country”

\- Daniel Patrick Moynihan

**The point**:

SoP is a deeply fascist authoritarian regime. That joke could just as well be about Palestine. And the quote explains why. Significant criticism of the Palestinian Authority leads to [torture](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/01/palestinian-authority-routinely-tortures-detainees-says-human-rights-watch#:~:text=The%20report%20alleged%20that%20Palestinian,intimidate%20critics%20and%20opponents%20and) or [death](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nizar_Banat).

We don't know the full scale of the SoP's debasement of human rights because reporting them is dangerous and in the case of those in Gaza - far more so.

But we know enough.

\----

If you look at the territory of the SoP, ie territories it fully or partially controls (Gaza, Area A & Area B) you notice something interesting:

* 99.9% Arab
* 98.5% Sunni Muslim

That is as close to homogeneity as you get. So we can say with absolute certainty that SoP is not multicultural. This is problematic as lack of contact with ""the other"" breeds intolerance, or has done so historically.

But the key to SoP racism... is the status of Jews owning property in Palestine. Consider:

* There are Palestinian fatwas or laws with [penalties up to death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_land_laws) for selling land or property to Israelis, but
* It seems [Arab Israelis can buy](https://www.timesofisrael.com/lured-by-cheap-prices-and-luxury-digs-arab-israelis-are-snapping-up-west-bank-homes/) properties openly, the restrictions still exist, but they can be overlooked - especially if buying an apartment.

Now lets talk about some complex facts:

* One (of many) Palestinian negotiation red lines is that all settlers (i.e. Jews) must leave \[aka ""ethnic cleansing""\], presumably because:
   * Jews can't own land/property in Palestine, and/or
   * Palestine wants to preserve its 99.9% Arab | 98.5% Sunni Muslim constituency
* When Palestinian politicians are asked why Jews can't stay, the typical response is that invaders/belligerents can't stay. The same argument that Israel did \*not\* use when it formed with a 20% Arab minority after a war in which the Arab League belligerently invaded Israel.
* It is also the case that Palestinian leaders clam up when asked about RoR for descendants of Jews turfed out of Palestine by Palestinian Arabs and Jordanians - i.e. the descendants of Jews of [Kfar Etzion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kfar_Etzion_massacre) on whose remains Gush Etzion (a ""settlement"") was built.
* Unreasonable expectations, vis-a-vis the effects of 1948. Like it or not, Palestinians were an outgrowth of the Arab League's desire to restore some version of the Arab Empire in the form of a Federation, and even though Palestinians were not sovereign, they were a party to the war:
   * Palestinians had zero problem when Arabs ethnically cleansed Jews from Palestine and other Arab countries, and
   * Israelis had zero problem resettling those ethnically cleansed Jews, and
   * Palestinians kicked up a massive stink when Jews ethnically cleansed Arabs from Palestine, and
   * Palestinians (and the Arab League) have a problem resettling those ethnically cleansed Arabs...
   * ... which begs the question as to why Palestinian leadership holds Jews responsible for the welfare of Arabs in a war started by the Arabs.

There are a few other items:

* It's generally bad practise to [elect Holocaust Deniers](https://web.archive.org/web/20090904093310/http://jta.org/news/article/2009/08/31/1007549/hamas-condemns-un-for-teaching-the-holocaust) or those who [wrote a book denying it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Other_Side:_The_Secret_Relationship_Between_Nazism_and_Zionism). The Palestinians did.
* It's especially bad to (in 2023) be advertising said book on [the presidential government website](https://president.ps/books.aspx).
* Much of popularly-elected [Hamas's policy and ideology against Jews](https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/protocols-of-the-elders-of-zion), draws against \*The Protocols of the Elders of Zion\* - the most notorious and widely distributed antisemitic publication of modern times.
* There is deeply antisemitic hate content in Palestinian [school textbooks](https://www.eureporter.co/politics/european-parliament-2/2022/04/01/palestinian-authority-slammed-by-eu-budget-committee-for-new-textbooks-with-increased-hate-speech-and-violence/), and the problem seems to be getting worse.
* The antisemitic hate content is likely feeding Palestine's status of the most, or [one of the most](https://global100.adl.org/country/west-bank-and-gaza/2014) antisemitic societies on the planet.
* When the Palestinian leaders [murder a non-jew by accident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Khoury_(murder_victim)), they'll apologise profusely and offer the family restitution and their murdered child the status of martyr - no such nicety is afforded to families of Jews murdered on purpose. Or they'll drag the chain on the investigation to make sure [no-one is ever prosecuted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juliano_Mer-Khamis). To this day, I'm unaware of a single Arab convicted by the Palestinian legal system of any crime against Jews.
* And then the ""best till last"" -> the Pay to Slay policy. This is where the Martyrs' Fund administered by the PLO pays additional stipends to Arabs or to their families based on number of Jews murdered and the location in which they murdered them. Basically, the law dictates that the deadlier the terror attack, the richer the reward.

FYI, Jews are not the only people, against whom racism is openly shown by Palestinian politicians. Palestinian Ahmadiya [cop it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmadiyya_in_Palestine) pretty hard as well.

I've tried to not stray into ""who said what"" territory and ignored the innumerable racist statements of Palestinian leaders. Frankly, what someone says is generally less relevant than what someone does.

The above is more than enough to show how deeply, legally and practically, racism is in the fabric of Palestinian politics and society.",thermonuclear_pickle,t2_maadi,0.76,69,221
1018,178j3sy,2023-10-15,IsraelPalestine,The Seven Fallacies of the Palestine Land Issue by Professor Ping Zhang.,"**\[Fallacy 1\]** Before partition, 93% (depending on the version, some say 95%, others say the vast majority) of the land belonged to the Arabs, while the Jews only purchased a little over 6% of the land. Typically, an accompanying map shows all of Palestine painted green, with only a few white dots representing Jewish land.  
  
**\[Rebuttal by Ping Zhang\]** This fallacy is half truth and half lie: The Jewish ownership of a little over 6% is true, but the 93% claimed by the Arabs is an outright lie! Whether during the Ottoman Empire or the British Mandate, the vast majority of the land in Palestine was state-owned (public or under royal ownership). For example, the Negev Desert, which covered over 13,000 square kilometers (about 50% of the total area of Palestine), was originally under the ownership of the Ottoman Sultan before World War I and during the mandate period, it was considered royal land, which means it belonged to Her Majesty the Queen. It was never private land (who would be foolish enough to buy useless desert land). Arabs who claim that this land was theirs should check if their blood is blue.  
  
So how much land did the Arabs actually own in Palestine? Any responsible scholar will tell you: no one knows! The land owned by the Jews was registered with the Turkish and British land management authorities, and even though it was only 6%, every transaction was recorded in black and white. Arabs, on the other hand, no matter how much land they claim to have, rarely have the relevant documents to prove it. If we were to calculate land ownership based on registered property, even if it might slightly exceed 6%, it probably wouldn't be much more (the Turks concealed a significant portion of land registration data, making it impossible to confirm completely).  
  
**\[Fallacy 2\]** Palestinians have ownership of Palestinian land in the form of ""fellah"" (an Arab term refers to farmer, particularly native).  
  
**\[Rebuttal by Ping Zhang\]** Because they cannot provide proof of land ownership, Arab scholars and their followers have invented a so-called ""fellah"" ownership system, claiming that Palestinians own land in this way.  
  
The so-called ""fellah"" land ownership refers to a traditional Arab way of distributing land rights by village, where each family is allocated land for cultivation each year and can only use it, not own it. The following year, the land is redistributed. This was originally a land use system that did not involve ownership issues (serious literature on Islamic land ownership systems typically does not consider "" fellah "" as a form of land ownership; discussions on this form of land ownership usually relate to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict). In the "" fellah"" system, it is not clear who owns the land, its size and location, or its transaction history. Any property registration system would not be able to register this type of land, so neither the Ottoman Empire nor the British Mandate authorities recognized this as a form of land ownership, and neither does the State of Israel.  
  
Even if we were to accept this form of land ownership, the amount of land owned by Arabs would still not be substantial. According to two surveys conducted by British authorities in the 1920s and 1930s, the cultivable land in the Palestine region was approximately 33%. In 1942, the United Nations estimated that Arabs in residential areas had land ownership rates of around 68%. Based on this estimation, Arabs should have owned around 23% of the land. Even if we generously give Palestinians an extra 10% (considering the Palestinian population in urban areas), that's still only around 30%. In other words, even if we consider the unverified claims of land ownership, it's far from the 93% that Arabs self-proclaim.  
  
**\[Fallacy 3\]** Arabs in Palestine constitute more than 120,000 people, accounting for two-thirds of the total population. Still, the territory assigned to the Arab state in the partition resolution only accounts for 43% of the total area of Palestine. Jews, numbering less than 600,000, less than one-third of the population, have been allocated 57% of the total area of Palestine. Therefore, the partition resolution is unjust.  
  
**\[Rebuttal by Ping Zhang\]** The partition of Palestine was about the establishment of two separate national states, and it had nothing to do with the population size! It's like inheriting an estate; it's about rights, not the number of people.  
  
Even if you were to connect the population to the land, this fallacy is still a lie because it conceals the issue of land quality. While Jews received 57%, 50% of it is the aforementioned Negev Desert, which, apart from a few oases, is mostly unsuitable for human habitation, especially in the late 1940s. Even in modern-day Israel, with advanced drip irrigation technology and leading desert agriculture, most of the Negev region remains desolate and uninhabited. In other words, only 7% of the land allocated to Jews is suitable for living, including a few oases in the desert. In contrast, Arabs received 43% of the land, with the exception of small plots along the Dead Sea, which are all arable and suitable for human habitation.  
  
The allocation of land in Palestine is not a new issue. As early as 1936, the British Peel Commission proposed a partition plan that gave Arabs around 80% of the land, including the Negev, and Jews around 20% in the north. Arabs vehemently rejected this proposal. In 1947, in the UN partition plan, Jews received the Negev, a much smaller portion of land than the 80% initially proposed, but Arabs were still unwilling to accept it. From these two instances of partition, we can see a fundamental principle: the side with less desirable land receives more, and the side with less desirable land receives less. No matter how you evaluate it, this is a fair principle. Therefore, Arab complaints about the unfairness of land division are just an excuse; fundamentally, they want to engage in ethnic cleansing in Palestine, and they would not be satisfied with any partition plan.  
  
**\[Fallacy 4\]** The Arab state's territory is fragmented and not contiguous.  
  
**\[Rebuttal by Ping Zhang\]** When one piece of land is divided into six, each side takes three, naturally they are not contiguous. Is the territory of the Jewish state contiguous? Even on such an obvious issue, saying half and hiding the other half, do they think everyone is naive?  
  
**\[Fallacy 5\]** The Arab state's territory consists mostly of hilly and barren areas, while the Jewish state, by contrast, is mostly along the coast with fertile land.  
  
**\[Rebuttal by Ping Zhang\]** By now, intelligent readers can probably debunk this statement themselves. Most of Israel's land is the Negev Desert, which is not on the coast and is far from fertile. The most fertile parts of Israel are in the eastern Galilee, the Jezreel Valley, and the Hula Valley. These areas were malarial swamps when under Arab control. Arabs would not be willing to accept this land even if it was given to them. Along the coastal plain, there are some farming areas, but the main cities, Tel Aviv and Haifa, were established by Jews. The Arab population in these cities mainly consists of immigrants who rely on the Jewish economy. Even if you were to give this land to Arabs, would they want it?  
  
In contrast, the land given to Arabs in Palestine includes the fertile western Galilee, bordering Lebanon, with lush greenery and abundant water resources. The southern coastal Gaza Strip has highly fertile agricultural land. The central hilly region has access to scarce underground water resources, and while it may not be fertile, it's still a suitable area for human habitation. The Jordan River Valley in the east is also a fertile farming area. Given these conditions, it's misleading to label their land as barren. Do they truly think only paradise is suitable for them to live in?  
  
**\[Fallacy 6\]** The establishment of Israel was due to European anti-Semitism, and Israel should have been established in Europe rather than in Palestine.  
  
**\[Rebuttal by Ping Zhang\]** The right to self-determination for nations includes the right for a nation to identify and choose its own homeland. Of course, the implementation of this right requires international recognition. Therefore, like any other nation in the world, the Jewish people have the right to choose their homeland. After international recognition, the rights of the Jewish people to their land are as sacred and inviolable as the relationship between any nation and its land. In this regard, if we must bring up historical accounts, Arabs have even less of a right to interfere. If not for their invasion and occupation of Jewish land in the past, if not for their obstruction of Jewish return in the 1930s, Jews would not have been driven to the point of becoming refugees, facing the threat of extermination without a place to go.  
  
The Jews have established effective governance on this land three times in history, possessing unquestionable historical rights. Moreover, mainstream Jewish tradition has never abandoned these rights. Modern Jewish Zionism strengthened the Jewish presence on this land through legal means. In 1947, the Jewish state accepted the UN partition resolution and explicitly expressed its willingness to coexist peacefully with the Arab state. In 1948, Israel won the war against aggression, legally expanded its territory, and received international recognition. Today, Israel is willing to allow Palestinians to establish their state beyond the Green Line and withdraw its military presence, as long as this state does not threaten Israel's security.  
  
Therefore, from any perspective, the land within the Green Line rightfully belongs to Israel, and the land outside the Green Line can be returned to the Palestinians at any time (settlements are something that can be removed). It is not part of Israel's establishment on Palestinian land!  
  
**\[Fallacy 7\]** Israel has occupied Palestinian land to establish a state.  
  
**\[Rebuttal by Ping Zhang\]** This claim has only one problem: why do Palestinians claim that this land is theirs?  
  
Determining the ownership of a piece of land can have several forms: historical rights, present existence, international treaties, and the outcome of wars.  
  
Palestinians have never established their own government in their history, and they have never had any historical rights to this land. Private land ownership is unclear, and present existence is also ambiguous. In 1947, the UN partition resolution was the first time Palestinians legally acquired land, but they subsequently initiated a war of aggression with Arab countries, which resulted in them losing a significant portion of the allocated land. When the ceasefire was established, Jews were given 80% of the land within the Green Line, while Arabs were left with 20%, exactly the opposite of the Peel Commission's proposal. It should be noted that Palestinians, by choosing to wage war against Israel, indicated their refusal to accept the land granted to them by international treaties and opted to resolve the issue through war, so the division of land was determined by the outcome of the war. In general, the international community considers the basis for resolving the Israeli-Palestinian land issue to be the Green Line, not the 1947 partition resolution. Defeated aggressors typically lose land; this is an international convention, and it applies to all defeated nations in the two World Wars. The Chinese are perhaps the only ones who emphasize repaying grievances with kindness, which is an exception.  
  
Jews have established effective governance on this land three times in history and possess undeniable historical rights, which mainstream Jewish tradition has never abandoned. In recent history, Jewish Zionism legally reinforced the Jewish people's presence on this land. In 1947, Israel accepted the UN partition resolution and expressed a willingness to coexist with an Arab state. In 1948, Israel won a war of self-defense, legally expanded its territory, and gained international recognition. Today, Israel is willing to allow Palestinians to establish their state beyond the Green Line and withdraw its military presence, as long as this state does not threaten Israel's security. In any case, whether from a historical or legal perspective, Israel has not gone beyond international conventions, and it did not establish itself on Palestinian land!

1019,17rz43l,2023-11-10,IsraelPalestine,"Is there anyone else who's ethnic background is Arab, and doesn't support a ceasefire in Palestine?","With everything going on (politically speaking) between Israel and Gaza, is there anyone else out there who is of the Arab ethnic background and doesn't support a ceasefire? I'm interested in hearing different perspectives. Of why and why not. 

My ethnic roots are of both the Arab and Israeli descent. I don't support a ceasefire. The main reason is the same as many others. If Israel allows a ceasefire, they are allowing Hamas to win. Furthermore, it allows Hamas the time to regroup and continue committing atrocities. I believe everyone has a right to stand up for themselves after the wrongdoing to others has been done, especially those we love and care for. I don't think Israel is wrong for defending themselves. I'm glad to hear they have a humanitarian pause for several hours of the day, allowing innocent civilians in Gaza to pass through as needed. It's terrible what's happening to all the innocent civilians on both ends of the spectrum.

I have a friend who's an IDF soldier. Currently in the line of duty and at war in Gaza. Every day, I wonder if it will be his last or if he'll make it out alive. Recently, we spoke. His family members were brutally murdered in the Nir Oz Kibbutz on October 7th. His mother, father, his grandmother and grandfather, his brother and sister. His aunts, uncles, and cousins. The only survivors are he and his older sister. They were not in Nir Oz that morning, hence the reason they're still alive. When I asked him what his opinion was on a ceasefire, he was absolutely against the idea of it. His reason stating ""What better way than to go after the roaches (because even animals are better hearted than Hamas) who brutally beat, then massacred my entire family. Slitting my mother's and grandmother's throats, dismembering my father, then shooting my entire family dead. And if that wasn't enough, then burn them while they're still dying."" I remained silent and placed myself in his position, unable to fathom exactly how I'd still be able to keep my sanity after such a traumatic loss. I'd be filled with anger, hatred, and rage as well. It's only human nature to want to get even in such circumstances....

It's really sad to see all the anti-semitism and islamophobia happening here in the United States. The pro Israeli v.s. the pro Palestinian protests and all the violence, threats, and as of late the killings taking place. It's absolutely vile and disgusting.

I'm interested in hearing from anyone and everyone what their opinions are on this. I'm Arab and Israeli. I'm literally of both ethnic backgrounds. I'm ashamed to say I'm Arab because of all the negativity frowned down upon being Arab at such a sensitive time for our world. Can anyone else relate?",DeclineUberEatsMay,t2_bvb69x20,0.77,68,315
1020,17no9tl,2023-11-04,IsraelPalestine,“Condemning Hamas” and the “Ceasefire” are both hilarious talking points,"These two points seem to be the two of the most hot-button topics when it comes to discussing what is happening in Israel and Palestine right now and both make me laugh for different reasons.

Condemning Hamas: I still follow a lot of very left-wing Palestine supporters I met in college and nothing seems to upset them more than the “Do you condemn Hamas?” line of questioning. What’s even more interesting is that a lot of them can’t seem to come to grips with the fact that they don’t. It’s blatantly obvious to everyone that Palestine supporters were celebrating the October 7th attacks. That’s just a fact, at least own up to it. You do not condemn Hamas. You hate Israel and want them to be destroyed, or at the very least for them to “lose” - however you define that. It’s not really that complicated. At least acknowledge what your own views are. If they make you uncomfortable when someone brings them up, maybe that’s a sign you should rethink them.

The Ceasefire: I genuinely am not sure the people calling for a ceasefire live in reality. You support Hamas, yet you want Israel to stop bombing Gaza after being attacked by the same people you support. You cannot just punch someone in the face and then ask them to stop when they respond by beating the shit out of you. This is another example of the need to acknowledge your real underlying views. You don’t want a ceasefire for “peace”, you want it so Hamas can regroup and attack again.",SmallToblerone,t2_hu6pws6,0.77,67,192
1021,136kb8e,2023-05-03,IsraelPalestine,Khader Adnan Dies and the Narrative Is Pushed,"If you’ve been on Twitter recently, or checked out the pretty much dead sub of /r/Israel_Palestine, you would see discussion about [Khader Adnan.](https://np.reddit.com/r/Israel_Palestine/comments/136e1e5/arrests_hunger_strikes_protests_the_life_of/) I’ll let the OP on Israel_Palestine sum up the Palestine position:

> veteran Palestinian activist Khader Adnan died under Israeli administrative detention after 88 days of hunger strike.
> Regardless of what one thinks of his political affiliations and views, there is no denying his treatment was a gross violation of his Human and Civil Rights, having spent the best part of the last two decades in and out of administrative detention, not once being charged with any specific crime, much less sentenced. 

And what were his “political affiliations and views”? Well, [he was a member of Islamic Jihad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khader_Adnan), a terrorist group with the blood of hundreds of Israelis on their hands and was described by Reuters as an “Islamic Jihad leader.” His Wikipedia page says he was their spokesperson for years. 

> A YouTube video of a rally in 2007 shows him praising and encouraging suicide bombings: ""Who among you will carry the next explosive belt? Who among you will fire the next bullets? Who among you will have his body parts blown all over?”

What a great guy! 

Upon his death, pro-Palestine Twitter and news outlets like Al Jazeera went full propaganda and hero worship of Adnan. You can read the OP statement above that Adnan “not once being charged with any specific crime, much less sentenced.” Numerous outlets came out to spread the same “fact” and praise for Adnan.

[Al Jazeera](https://twitter.com/AJEnglish/status/1653645579627503616): “Prominent Palestinian activist Khader Adnan died in an Israeli prison on May 2 after nearly three months on hunger strike in protest over his detention without charge” 

[Muhammed Shehada](https://twitter.com/muhammadshehad2/status/1653412289914056704): “Khader Adnan was NOT a militant & wasn't involved in any attacks. #Israel detained him 10 times without trial or charges for ~9 years”

[Omar Shakir of Human Rights Watch Israel Palestine Division](https://twitter.com/OmarSShakir/status/1653255187568513026): “He [Adnan] valiantly struggled against injustice—multiple months-long hunger strikes against administrative detention—until his last breath. He never enjoyed a minute of freedom but dies w his head raised high. His resilience wont be forgotten”.

[Palestine Info Center](https://twitter.com/palinfoen/status/1653230925067501569): “Breaking; Hunger striking Palestinian prisoner Khader Adnan passes away in Israeli gulags after 86 days. Israel arbitrarily arrested Adnan without charge or trial.”

[Palestine Online](https://twitter.com/OnlinePalEng/status/1653691317128495107): “Prominent Palestinian activist Khader Adnan died in an Israeli prison yesterday after nearly three months on hunger strike in protest over his detention without charge”.

[Ali Abunimah](https://twitter.com/AliAbunimah/status/1653224678473842688): ““Israeli” media reports that Khader Adnan has died after 86 days of hunger strike against his detention without charge or trial by the Zionist enemy occupier. This is an enormous crime. Adnan never wanted to die but to live free. Israel chose to murder him”.

So the narrative is set in place. Adnan was an activist who was held without charge in a great example of injustice. 

Unfortunately, like so much else in the Palestine narrative, that simply wasn’t the case. The Guardian (hardly a friend to Israel) reports:

> [Adnan was arrested again on 5 February after **being indicted for incitement and membership of a terrorist organisation,** and began the hunger strike a few days later.](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/02/palestinian-khader-adnan-dies-in-israel-jail-after-87-day-hunger-strike)

Al Jazeera and all of these pro-Palestine media outlets are either lying or misinformed. Adnan was certainly charged, and it’s a lie to say otherwise. You can argue that he shouldn’t have been charged, or that he was set up, or whatever else you want, but you cannot lie to the world and say he wasn’t charged. He was.

As always, I find it funny that all of these pro-Palestine folks are suddenly so concerned about justice and a fair trial. The suicide bombers that Adnan was calling for in 2007, did they give a fair trial to the people they blow up? Were the Israelis murdered by Islamic Jihad charged with anything? But maybe that’s different, because it’s not Palestinians who were the victims then? 

It’s fascinating to the kind of people that Palestine idolizes. Adnan was indisputably a terrorist. He indisputably helped in the murder and terrorism of Israelis. Of all the people to lie and make a victim out of, why choose this guy? Aren’t there actual good people in Palestine who are actually suffering for no reason that Ali Abunimah and the rest can tweet about instead of Adnan? I don’t get it.",TracingBullets,t2_w8btvkv3,0.84,63,126

BRUSSELS (AP) — The European Union announced Monday that it was “immediately” suspending hundreds of millions of euros in aid for Palestinian authorities because of what an EU commissioner called the “scale of terror and brutality” during the attacks on Israel by Hamas.

Germany and Austria also announced similar measures.

“We need action and we need it now,” EU Commissioner Oliver Varhelyi tweeted. It also underscored strong words of EU support for Israel since the Hamas attacks started on Saturday, including that Israel had now every right to defend itself within the bounds of international law.

We had discussions where I expressed my support for a ceasefire and a two-state solution while also acknowledging the pain I feel as a Jewish person for what's happening. I feel heavy hearted for both sides

She posts 10 stories a day more or less on the war, she’s very active politically online whereas I’m not. She only posts about Palestine and she bought a bunch of Palestinian books based on history.

I also mentioned not wanting to go alone. Bare in mind we live together

According to this report, Iran three months ago cut off all funding to terrorist organizations operating in Israel-Palestine, likely including Hamas, PIJ, and PFLP. It claims the leaders of said groups attribute this to the ongoing protests in Iran, although obviously any evidence is sketchy at best.

It's worth noting that there's some evidence that the regime's policy towards Israel are not terribly popular among the Iranian public, and there are reports that ""death to Palestine"" is used as a slogan by protestors by way of mocking Iranian foreign policy. At the same time, it's unlikely to be a concession to protestors, very little of their goals have to do with this aspect of Iranian foreign policy.

Nonetheless, this represents perhaps the strongest evidence thus far of the protests crippling the IRI's ability to influence regions in its near abroad. It remains to be seen, however, how this will play out as apparently the groups' financial situation reaches a crisis point.",Matar_Kubileya,t2_4bf2sab4,0.9,67,17
1027,17a9k0p,2023-10-17,IsraelPalestine,Six BBC reporters taken off air as probe launched over pro-Palestine tweets,"  
The BBC has taken six reporters in the Middle East off air and launched an investigation into posts on social media that seemed to support activities of Hamas against Israel.  
The broadcaster has strict rules on impartiality, which cover its reporters’ activities on social media. Posts that were tweeted or liked by BBC News Arabic reporters, including those based in Egypt and Lebanon, appeared to support Palestine or criticise the position of Israel.  
The BBC has now taken all six off air, though they have not been formally suspended, pending an urgent investigation into their activities as BBC employees.  
In a statement, the BBC said: “We are urgently investigating this matter. We take allegations of breaches of our editorial and social media guidelines with the utmost seriousness, and if and when we find breaches we will act, including taking disciplinary action.”  
All the posts have been taken down, but media reports suggest that one reporter liked a message that appeared to describe Hamas, the Palestinian militant movement that attacked Israel nine days ago, as “freedom fighters”.  
The move to name the journalists by some media outlets has raised concerns over their safety while the investigation is carried out.  
The broadcaster has already faced questions over its position on Hamas from politicians demanding changes to its editorial policy on calling the group militants rather than terrorists.    
Downing Street on Monday again questioned the BBC’s stance, saying the word “terrorists” was appropriate given that the group’s recent attack on Israel was the third most deadly terrorist attack since the 1970s.  
A spokesperson for Number 10 said the BBC had used the word “terrorists” in relation to other attacks including 9/11 and the Bataclan massacre in Paris. “A number of reporting organisations are accurately describing Hamas as a terrorist group, I think accuracy is important in all circumstances,” he said.  
The BBC said its reporting had explained that Hamas was proscribed as a terrorist organisation by many western governments, including the UK, and featured contributors who had described them as terrorists.  
But the broadcaster has insisted that as an editorially independent organisation, its role is to explain what is happening so that the public can make their own judgments.

\-Hamas inflates death counts [like they did with the hospital](https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-france-intelligence-7be0d59b9ceb58bbf2f03c5dc8222356)

Regarding the U.N. Resolutions, the GA has always been heavily against Israel, because of the Arab voting block. [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/17jcuwa/comment/k71ixpt/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) is a good overview:

> Because Arab lobbying bloc. It is a guaranteed ~100 votes from the OIC nations and poor African states, as well as a few key abstentions from East Asia for almost every resolution. The Arabs can pretty much strongarm anything through the UNGA. [...] This is why Israel realized as early as the 1960s, that it was no use reacting to every UNGA resolution. Abba Eban, one of Israel's biggest diplomatic figures, quipped:""If Algeria introduced a resolution declaring that the earth was flat and that Israel had flattened it, it would pass by a vote of 164 to 13 with 26 abstentions.""

Remember that the [UN GA Resolution 3379](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly_Resolution_3379), declaring Zionism itself ""a form of racism and racial discrimination"", was in effect between 1975-91. The international support for Israel has risen significantly since then.

Even the Arab world has sticked by the Abraham accords, all the while condemning Israel in words. For example, the Chairmen of Foreign Affairs Committee at the UAE Federal National Council [said today](https://ejpress.org/are-the-abraham-accords-stronger-thant-the-war-between-israel-and-hamas/) that ""The [Abraham] Accords are our future"" and ""We want everyone to acknowledge and accept that Israel is there to exist"". The Saudis too have [indicated](https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/17g2cnf/white_house_saudis_mbs_indicates_israel/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) that normalisation is still on the cards once the war with Hamas is over.

1031,17laxmx,2023-11-01,IsraelPalestine,The hypocrisy of Queers for Palestine matters,"I would like to concentrate here my full opinions on the Palestine and LGBT thing, because I've seen the same bad takes being made a lot.

The main point I see is ""but there's queer Palestinians!"", which is technically true. Some of them become refugees in Israel. But if you support a ""from the river to the sea"" mentality, then you support turning the only LGBT safe space in the Middle East into one controlled by Muslim conservatives. That would absolutely negatively affect not only LGBT Palestinians, but also the Israeli LGBT community that's doing pretty well right now. You may say ""I'm not advocating for that kind of state"" or ""I support a 2 state solution"" and that's fine. I support a 2 state solution too. But Palestinians don't. If you see any polls or ""man on the street"" interviews, you would clearly see that they want all of the land. You would also see that the majority does not like LGBT people. Ultimately, it doesn't matter what people who don't live there want, because the most they can do is broadly steer the conflict. An American doesn't get to decide if Palestine would protect LGBT people or even if it would be a democracy at all.

Another point is ""them being homophobic still doesn't justify genocide or apartheid"". And my response is that considering the events of 10/7, if Hamas would ever successfully ""free Palestine"", the bloodshed would surpass all of the IDF's war crimes combined.

It was removed after dozens of comments and several hours. I feel that the thoughts here are valid and should be preserved, so I am posting it here. I hope that the mods here are a bit more open minded. Thank you for reading. *]

For those of you logging on today for the first time in a while, allow me to summarize what I have learned over the past 72 hours.

First we had a thread about how [Israel is or is not an apartheid state](https://reddit.com/r/Israel_Palestine/comments/10lw16c/eu_says_its_antisemitic_to_call_israel_an/), in which I was told the instruments of the occupation (the blockade, checkpoints etc.) exist not to keep Israelis safe but to create a system of Jewish domination over Arabs, and this system is in place because Jews hate Arabs and are racist towards them.

Then we had [a thread about a firefight in Jenin](https://reddit.com/r/Israel_Palestine/comments/10m2jso/israel_army_kills_10_palestinians_including/) in which [the entire sub was lied to and told that an IDF unit went into Jenin and shot nine Palestinians for no reason other than election votes.](https://reddit.com/r/Israel_Palestine/comments/10m2jso/israel_army_kills_10_palestinians_including/j60iz1x/) After some users pointed out that seven of those nine Palestinians were Islamic Jihad terrorists planning a terror attack, they were met with a wall of denial and statements that [Israelis always lie so you can't believe anything they say.](https://reddit.com/r/Israel_Palestine/comments/10oa08r/thoughts_on_this/j6epxdl/), preferring instead a narrative that the terrorists were ordinary townsfolk defending their homes. 

Then we had [one of the most horrific murderous attacks on Jews by a Palestinian](https://reddit.com/r/Israel_Palestine/comments/10mtw5h/at_least_5_killed_in_jerusalem_synagogue_shooting/) since the Itamar Massacre, in which almost no Palestine supporters even bothered to show up on the thread, except for one user who spent hours and hours posting hundreds of comments on a Friday night trying to justify the attack. [Palestinians themselves celebrated the attack](https://reddit.com/r/Israel_Palestine/comments/10nc1hi/palestinians_celebrate_jerusalem_synagogue/), and again, no responses from Palestine supporters beyond some whataboutery. 

Lastly we had another attack, [this one a triple war crime,](https://reddit.com/r/Israel_Palestine/comments/10ngymb/two_seriously_hurt_in_2nd_jerusalem_terror/) and again, almost no Palestine supporters showed up to condemn it or say anything other than whataboutery. 

What did I learn from these four threads, all of which conveniently lied up next to each other on the timeline? 

1. Israeli violence and military action, such as the occupation and the IDF raid, are always assumed to be entirely motivated by anti-Arab racism. There is no benefit of the doubt, there is no compromise, there is no alternatives in the minds of Palestine supporters to this belief. Israelis are always racist and everything they do is racist. 
2. Palestine and its supporters do not believe any of the principles they allegedly preach. They do not actually believe in international law. They do not actually believe in human rights. The moment one of their precious Palestinian victims violated those principles, our friendly local supporters were nowhere to be found. The moment international law and human rights could have applied and protected someone other than Palestinians, they were dropped like a hot potato. The only principles they genuinely have are ethnic tribalism and Arab supremacy. 

I no longer have any interest in hearing Palestine supporters speak the language of human rights, international law, or even basic morality after this weekend. /r/Palestine didn't even post a thread about the synagogue shooting because (I suspect) they would have too many people in support of it and could risk a sitewide ban for supporting violence. All of the sympathy and understanding Palestine supporters had for Islamic Jihad terrorists could not be extended even a little bit to Jewish civilians, and thus I have no sympathy and understanding left for them.

And for the first time in my life I am genuinely scared for me, my family, and my people. And every Jewish person I have spoken with has reported feeling the same way. I originally wrote a version of this at 5am after tossing and turning for an hour.

I am scared because a shift has taken place in the world that is terrifying. I felt the trauma that other Jews felt after the attack itself, but we can deal with traumatic events. We're used to it and we're a resilient people. Once the initial trauma wore off for me, I actually started to feel more uplifted. I was warmed by the overwhelming voices of support and solidarity, and the strong words of condemnation for the attack and the rallies that were taking place in support of the attack. But that uplifting feeling has given way to more trauma and fear.

The supportive voices have been drowned out by voices of hate all over the world. People taking to the streets and to university campuses to show their support for the brutal terror attacks. Now before you jump right to, ""Well free speech, people have the right to protest against Israel,"" please take a breath and look up some of the videos of these rallies. These people aren't protesting anything. They're not speaking out against Israeli policies; they're not pleading with Israel to show restraint in its retaliation; they're not even appealing to people like you to donate to Gaza relief funds or anything of that nature. They are openly justifying and calling for a genocide of the Jewish people. They are celebrating the carnage that took place as a form of ""resistance against the oppression,"" and implicitly (and sometimes explicitly) calling for more of it. Student unions at our universities, which are supposed to represent our children, are issuing statements of solidarity with the Palestinians and celebrating the resistance. Jewish students are scared to go to school. And university admins are standing back and doing nothing, ""cuz free speech"" and ""student unions are independent from administration"" and all that. I watched a video yesterday of female Jewish students at the University of Washington who were hysterical in tears and pleading with an administrator on the grounds of the school because they had to walk past a gauntlet of ""protesters"" telling them they deserve to die. These rallies have even taken place on the streets of Toronto, which is one of the most diverse and tolerant cities in one of the most diverse and tolerant countries on the planet.

It's important to appreciate the significance of what is happening. This must be what it felt like for our ancestors in Europe in the 1930's, watching angry rallies blaming Jewish people for their problems and justifying violence to address those problems. Experts have spent decades studying the psychology of the Holocaust to understand both how the kind of evil can exist that can drive people to commit such heinous acts, but also how other people can justify and support it. And there are now generations of people born after WWII that are starting to understand, because we are seeing eerie similarities now.

This has to stop. Solidarity with Palestine has officially crossed the line into calls for genocide. If you find yourself screaming that an entire population of people deserves to be brutally massacred in the name of ""decolonization"" or ""resistance to oppression,"" you have lost your way as a human being. Moderate voices must rise up and drown out these extremists.

1034,17sdgpc,2023-11-10,IsraelPalestine,"A Condensed History of ""From the River to the Sea""","**Non-English Origins:**

The phrase “Min el-maiyeh lel mayieh” (from water to water) [is rooted in Palestinian](https://jewishcurrents.org/what-does-from-the-river-to-the-sea-really-mean) folklore and songs, featuring various Arabic versions. Historically, the most used political chant in Arabic appears to be “Min el-maiyeh lel mayieh, Falasteen Arabiya” (From water to water, Palestine is Arab) but you can also find historical instances of “Min al-Nahr ila al-Bahr, Filistin satakunu hurra” (From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free). Both lines rhyme.

Some writers, including Seraj Assi, have said the term originates from the [Zionist Organization Statement on Palestine](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/zionist-organization-statement-on-palestine-at-the-paris-peace-conference) at the Paris Peace Conference in 1918, which aimed at establishing Israel/Palestine (which had no real proposed border at this point) as from *east* of the Jordan River to the Mediterranean. I do not think that this interpretation of the slogan's origins is credible, but I include it for completeness.

**History:**

* In 1960s, the English line “From the River to the Sea, Palestine will be Free” was popularized as part of a [wider call for Palestinian liberation](https://forward.com/opinion/415250/from-the-river-to-the-sea-doesnt-mean-what-you-think-it-means/) creating a democratic state separate from Israel as well as from other Arab regimes such as Jordan and Egypt (who occupied the West Bank and Gaza respectively and who often clashed with Palestinian nationalists).
* In 1964, the phrase was adopted by the Palestine Liberation Organization in its founding documents and was seen as a call for returning to the borders under British control of Palestine. At the time, the PLO sought the elimination of Israel as a state separate from Palestine [\- Source.](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/09/us/politics/river-to-the-sea-israel-gaza-palestinians.html)
* In 1977, the phrase was used by the Israeli [Likud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likud) party (Netanyahu’s party). Their platform stated ""between the Sea and the Jordan there will only be Israeli sovereignty."" Likud has not recognized the right of a Palestinian state to exist.
* In 1988, following the Algiers Declaration, the phrase continued to be used by the PLO with the meaning now shifting to ""establishing a Palestinian state within the 1967 borders” which includes the West Bank of the Jordan River and the Gaza Strip on the Mediterranean Sea. Some commenters below who question the PLO's commitment to a two-state solution question this interpretation.
* In 2006, Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, stated in a speech, ""The Hamas movement will lead the Palestinian people to the heights of victory and will retrieve all of the Palestinian territories from the river to the sea, from Rosh HaNikra to Umm al-Rashrash."" This is the first use by Hamas that I could find, but there’s likely earlier uses.
* In 2012, Hamas leader Khaled Mashaal said in a [speech](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/09/world/middleeast/khaled-meshal-hamas-leader-delivers-defiant-speech-on-anniversary-celebration.html) that, “Palestine is ours from the river to the sea and from the south to the north. There will be no concession on any inch of the land.”
* In 2014, Religious Zionist politician Uri Ariel [said](https://www.srugim.co.il/68778-%D7%A9%D7%A8-%D7%94%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%9B%D7%95%D7%9F-%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%99-%D7%90%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%90%D7%9C-%D7%91%D7%99%D7%9F-%D7%94%D7%99%D7%A8%D7%93%D7%9F-%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%9D-%D7%AA%D7%94%D7%99), “Between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea there will be only one state, which is Israel.”
* In 2017, Hamas’s charter stated that it “rejects any alternative to the full and complete liberation of Palestine, from the river to the sea.”
* In 2018, Marc Lamont Hill, a pro-Palestinian commentator and professor at Temple University, was fired from a role at CNN after he used the phrase in a speech at the United Nations. More recently, he wrote on X denying that the phrase calls for Israel’s destruction, pointing to its usage as a call for liberation rather than destruction, and it’s use by some Israelis to advocate for Zionism.
* In 2020, Gideon Saar, a right-wing ally-turned-rival of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said, “Between the Jordan River and the sea there won’t be another independent state.”
* In 2023, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad declared that ""from the river to the sea — \[Palestine\] is an Arab Islamic land that \[it\] is legally forbidden from abandoning any inch of, and the Israeli presence in Palestine is a null existence, which is forbidden by law to recognize.”
* This month, Andy MacDonald, a UK Labour MP, was suspended from the party for saying, ""We won’t rest until we have justice, until all people, Israelis and Palestinians, between the river and the sea can live in peaceful liberty,”
* This week, Rashida Tlaib, a US Congresswoman, was censured for using the phrase. She clarified that she meant it as a call for a single, secular, one-state solution, where people of all religions have equal citizenship.

Draw your own conclusions from the above and draw your own conclusions when you see this phrase elsewhere. Look at what follows the phrase, who is using it, and in what context.",BigBlueSkies,t2_84k65,0.94,60,146
1035,17gwgp7,2023-10-26,IsraelPalestine,'Pro Palestinians' and Cult Mentality,"I will readily admit that I did not understand much about the Israeli Palestinian conflict prior to three weeks ago.  Like many people, I sort of stayed out if it and believed a lot is the buzz terms that were thrown around over the years.  

However one thing I would say I'm well read on is cults and cult mentality.  Here are a few observations I've made based on arguments and reading comments.


A quick note here, this is not to say everyone who supports Palestinians and their cause is in a cult. I personally support Palestinian rights tremendously. I am referring to the 'pro Palestinians' who share certain common traits. 


1. Cult members and leaders will not concede even small or seemingly irrelevant points.  

For example,  David Koresh (Waco) admitted lied that he ever played in a band when he was younger and recorded albums.  Jim Jones would not accept that he had a drug dependency problem even though he required and took drugs every day.  They won't concede or accept any truth on any issues if they believe it sheds bad light on them. 

Sound familiar? Many 'pro Palestinians' will not accept that there is antisemitism in the world or that it is a wider problem in Palestine. They won't accept that Hamas lied about the hospital - even though it doesn't really affect the pro Palestinian cause.


2. Invalidate all contrary facts as a conspiracy and hype 'fringe' sources. 

 Cult members from Scientology to Heavens Gate have done this for years. 

Anytime someone brings in scientific or historic evidence from  mainstream sources, the default tactic is to attack the sources.  Scientologists, when presented with lab tested evidence to show their ometers were bogus, immediately went on the attack to discredit the scientific community. There was a conspiracy to destroy them, and that the mainstream was oppressing the real voice. 
Again - this is typically of many pro Palestinians.  When faced with real evidence from multiple sources that have no motive to lie, they immediately attack the source and assume their is a Jewish lobbying conspiracy.  At the same time, they will cute sources with dubious and unverifiable 'facts' such as witness accounts not backed by evidence.

3.  Disengagement. 

 This one is the most tragic.  When faced with such extreme cognitive dissonance (two contrasting facts don't line up) cult members will disengage from further discussion, and flock to the people who validate their arguments. NXIVM members moved away from family, cut off communications, and saw themselves as living a separate enlightened life outside the 'norm'.  Anytime facts or reason became too real, they would simply cut themselves off. They then  brigade and are then accepted into the safe community that believes and validates them. 

4. Failure to accept responsibility.  

This one is the most terrifying since it's the reason cults do horrific things.  When people in jonestown started poisoning children and their loved ones it was all because of the government conspiracy to oppress them.  When the Proudboys instigate and then use violence, it's not the individual's responsibility. They are acting as part of a justifyable  'resistance movement'.  

How many lawyers, doctors, or politicians who've never even been to Palestine have said the most hateful, antisemetic rhetoric over the past two weeks? When asked about their own personal responsibility for those statements  it's the same excuse.  I was justifiedband not responsible because I'm part of something bigger. 

5. Recoding language. 

All cults have their own created internal lingo. These redefined terms to deprogram to suit the needs of the ideology.  Heavens gate members weren't taking poison to kill themselves, they were 'transporting'. Children of God sexually abused children as part of 'freeing' them.  

So you can see in the pro palestinian movement certain words have been twisted from their common meaning.  'genocide' is not like Bosnia, or the holocaust, it is about oppression and land disputes. 'War crimes' are not about the written laws in the Geneva convention, but about bombing military targets, killing any civilian.  Apartheid is not about south Africa, it's about a border checkpoint.  

6. Complete faith in their leaders and vilifying of 'enemies'.  

Cult members cannot accept their leaders are fallable.  They are often seen as inhuman, and impervious to human vices. There's no greed, ignorance, vanity, or deceit.  Contrarily, their 'enemies' have no bounds to the evil schemes.  Every one of their actions is motivated by the evil. 

This is why pro Palestinians have such a hard time accepting or critiquing things like rocket attacks on innocent civilians over the years were a stupid idea that made things worse.  Or that Hamas leaders are filthy rich from stolen money.  Or that UNRWA taught children antisemitic rhetoric in Gaza for a decade. It's also why pro Palestinians see Israel as pure evil motivated by racism, globalism, and pure hatred. 


As a final note - anyone is susceptible to cult followings.  There are Jewish people in pro Palestinian, intelligent well educated people, and people who have never even stepped foot outside a western country.  

It's also not trying to undermine the many hard working groups that do support Palestinians and their liberties. There are many groups that are furious with Palestinian leaders, see Israel as an ally in their cause, and desparetly want to open up relationships to create lasting peace and liberties for palestinians.  They have no problem debating, accepting past errors, compromising, and showing empathy while still advocating for their rights.",Ipassbutter2,t2_k2wov9u7,0.67,59,302
1036,178o87b,2023-10-15,IsraelPalestine,Thinking that Israel should provide humanitarian aid at this time is outrageous,"Many have been criticizing Israel for closing the border with Gaza and not sending in fuel and supplies for the duration of this war. But so many people seem to ignore that Gaza has TWO borders, the other with Egypt. Why doesn't Egypt open its border to Palestinian refugees and offer humanitarian support, as Arab countries did during the Syrian civil war? In their opinion, Israel must be responsible for feeding, watering, sustaining, and enabling jihadi terrorists even while they are currently attempting to eradicate Israel and all of its citizens, while Egypt can turn its back and evade international condemnation? What do they think Israel should do? Allow their civilians to be slaughtered just to avoid Westerners accusing it of forming an ""open-air prison""?Why doesn't Palestine provide its own citizens with basic humanitarian resources instead of relying on humanitarian aid from Israel? How is anyone even remotely surprised that it was taken away after Hamas perpetrated the worst terrorist attack Israel has ever seen

Edit: Israel said nothing would be allowed into Gaza until Hamas terrorists freed the 150 hostages taken during their deadly attack. That's literally all they have to do",chaotictaytay,t2_9rba5du9,0.75,61,110
1037,12t2krn,2023-04-20,IsraelPalestine,The language and symbolism of Palestinian nationalism is the biggest failure of one state advocacy,"One of the most common answers to ""what is the solution to the Israel/Palestine conflict"" encountered on the redditsphere is for there to be ""one democratic state with equal rights for all"".  Typically those that advocate this position dismiss the Jewish presence in the land as entirely settler-colonial in nature, diminish the importance of the Land of Israel in the development and maintenance of Jewish identity, while simultaneously embracing the language and symbolism of Palestinian nationalism.   Be that slogans such as ""from the river to the sea Palestine will be free"", ""Israel isn't real"", ""free Palestine"" and of course full on adoption of the Palestinian national flag as the symbol of this liberation.  

For anyone who adopts this position while simultaneously adopting this language and these symbols, can you please explain to me how this is beneficial to the Palestinian cause.  If you are truly serious about one democratic state for all, how is this possible without gaining the support of some critical mass of Israeli Jews?  Because right now the level of support for such a platform among Israel Jews (who still make up roughly 50% of the population of Israel and occupied territories) is close to 0.

A long time ago, I read the book by Hussein Ibbish titled ""What's Wrong With the One State Agenda"", which does a fantastic job of outlining the many failings of this line of advocacy.  He points to the fact that many of the most outspoken proponents of the one state agenda (Ali Abunimah, Omar Barghouti, etc.) have cloaked the nationalist goal of a Palestinian Arab state with the language of human rights and democracy, but have made no efforts to reconcile the two.  While this book is now 14 years old, I still have yet to see an effort among grassroots Palestinian activists to make the case to Jewish Israelis of how their lives, liberty and security will be protected in this future ""one democratic state"" outside of platitudes and niceties.

1038,17pkpjq,2023-11-07,IsraelPalestine,"My response to an American, pro-Hamas, BLM supporter","I am very glad to have found this post and I want to answer you with thought and a whole heart.  
   
First, I want to say that I am a lifelong Democrat.  Have marched with BLM and have supported MeToo and the women’s march, and so on.  I have learned about my privilege being white, a man, and heterosexual. I try to be aware of this privilege and support communities that are not empowered in the same way.  
   
Over the past month, I have been mortified to see that those that I support don’t support me as a Jew or Israeli.  On October 8th, I watched in horror as crowds gathered to cheer for Hamas.  Babies were baked in ovens in front of their parents.  Parents killed in front of their children. Babies, toddlers and children were carried off to captivity in the tunnels of Gaza. And people cheered, before Israel had even counted its dead. 

Today, Jews are attacked in the streets.  Posters of kidnapped children are removed, as if their existence doesn’t matter.  Our victims are to be erased.    
   
You mention that you are a member of a truly oppressed group.  But I want to remind you that no people in the history of the world have been as oppressed as the Jews.  Our civilization was destroyed by the Babylonians in 722 BC and we were carried off to captivity in Babylon. But we rebuilt, only to have hundreds of thousands killed by the Romans in 70 CE.  And thus began our almost 2000 years in the Diaspora.  Jews moved all over the world but were never truly accepted.  We suffered discrimination and brutal state-sectioned pogroms. The Inquisition persecuted Jews from 1231 until 1834- making being Jewish punishable by torture and death.   The diaspora of course culminated with the most systematic genocide in the history of the world.  6,000,000 Jews were killed in Europe- 2/3 of the entire population of Jews.  And as I mentioned above, our dehumanization continues every day.  
   
So yes, we have a country now- a tiny country surrounded by enemies that seek its destruction.  It's important to note that while Israel and Israelis are not perfect- we have made mistakes, and we have our share of bad actors- Israel itself is a country that believes in Western, enlightenment values- life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.  Hamas believes in Jihad, Sharia law, and martyrdom.  They attacked Israel with wanton cruelty.  Why they did it is hard to understand- they KNEW Israel would have no choice but to fight back with all their force and might.  But from their mindset, death means glory.  To die as a martyr fighting for their land is a wonderful thing. Israel, on the other hand, cherishes life. There is no concept of martyrdom.  No heaven of 70 virgins.  
   
I agree that Palestinians deserve a better life.  But from an Israeli perspective, it's hard to take down the walls and open the border when you know the people on the other side want you dead more than they want to be alive.  This incident makes things 100 times worse.  Gazans complain about their economy and their opportunities- but billions of dollars have gone into building tunnels, acquiring weapons and enriching their leaders in Qatar.  When Israel watches this happening, how can they open the borders to travel and trade?  Hamas is a very dangerous enemy already- even with the restrictions- but it could, and would be worse.  
   
I want to say a word about privilege.  I, as a white man, have had to realize that I have privilege- it is real.  But no one ever seems to talk about religious privilege. There are almost 2 billion Christians, and 1.5 billion Muslims. Every day we are surrounded by Christian hegemony, from radio stations to billboards, to Christmas trees, to prayer at football games.  There are 5 million Jews in the United States. There are 42 million Christians, and 210 million Christians. I want you to take a minute and think about how we feel when we see your post and the 1000s like it.  
If you, as a Christian, wanted to move to another country where Christians weren’t persecuted- you could move to one of 151 other countries.  If you, as a Muslim, wanted to move to a predominantly Muslim country, you could choose one of 49.  Jews make up but .2% of the world's population- and there is ONE predominantly Jewish country.  Israel.   
   
For thousands of years, we have never felt truly safe.  Even today, in America, we don’t feel truly safe.  Thousands of protesters line the streets and scream for our death and demise.  Our allies in civil rights suddenly turn their backs on us.  We wonder- could it happen here?  Where would we go? How can we be safe?  
   
I want also to address your comment on Colonialism. When the French colonized Algeria- they could go back to France.  But where do the Jews go back to?  The majority of Israelis are of Middle Eastern descent.  Their homes were taken from them and they fled to Israel. To Poland where our history of 1000 years was erased?    
   
My family came from Germany and Russia, where they lived until it wasn’t safe for them anymore. Every Jew has the same story- our history if full of moving from place to place to escape persecution- thus “The Wandering Jew.”  
Where was my family before Germany?  Our history is lost in the fog of time, but it all goes back to Israel. It is where our people were born. Where we had our kingdom and civilization 1500 years before Mohammed walked the Earth. Where Jesus was born and lived as a Jew before the Romans destroyed Jerusalem. It is the only homeland we have ever known.  And it is mentioned in our bible hundreds of times- while Palestine is not mentioned once in the Quran.  We are not colonizers- we are the indigenous people reunited with the land.  
   
Finally, I find it so ironic to see Americans claim that Israel is committing genocide and that we are colonizing the land.  Isn’t that the story of America?  Europeans decimated the indigenous people here- not to find a safe homeland for their endangered people.  Not to find their ancestral home.  But just for power.  And yet we are accused of these crimes by the people benefiting from those actual crimes.  
   
Somewhere around 7 million Jews are living in Israel- living in peace with their Muslim, Christian, Druze and Bedouin neighbors.  All live together in a civil liberal democracy. There are Arabs on the Supreme Court of Israel. Thousands of non-Jews serve in the Israeli army. Israel is worth fighting for.  Hamas has one goal - Israel’s destruction, even if it means its own destruction in the process.  They attacked with medieval savagery, and brutal sadism– to scar and terrorize us as a people, and to galvanize the world against us when we respond to the terror.  
   
Unfortunately, your support is what they want. You give them a victory in your post– flipping victim and perpetrator.  Seekers of peace and seekers of war.  Lovers of life and lovers of death.  
I know your instinct is good. You want to support an oppressed people. But you have to go deeper and look at what people want- look at their values.  I believe I am pro-Israel, pro-Palestine, and anti-Hamas. Hamas is the worst of humanity. They have no value for life, nor any desire to compromise.  They have been ruinous to the people of Gaza. And those people deserve better.  Sadly, this war has resulted in many deaths, but this is the nature of war.  Hamas must be removed from power.  No country could live with armed barbarians torturing and murdering their civilians.  But the goal of this war is not to kill civilians- it is to remove Hamas, and that goal must be pursed to the end.  
   
I hope you will reconsider your position and engage me in dialogue.   
   
Respectfully…

1039,17tizfn,2023-11-12,IsraelPalestine,The only think to thank Hamas for,"Is exposing people's true feelings about Jews. 

We got comfortable and that was a mistake. We believed our non Jewish friends when they said they loved us, our culture, our family orientated way of life. We believed them whe they said they understood our plight, when they empathised with our  history and appeared truly effected when talking about visited to Auschwitz and Holocaust museums. We felt a warmth in our hearts when they would visit Israel and tell us stories of how amazing, inclusive, modern yet full of culture it is. We welcomed them into our homes to share our food, music and laughter and believed them when they said it was full of joy and peace.

But it was all lies, a thin veil, a charade! You don't like us. You don't respect us. Some of you don't even think we should exist! It turns out, when it truly comes down to it, we are tolerated at best. So thank you Hamas. Thank you for shining huge spotlight onto the fact that when it really matters, we are alone and can only rely on each other!

1040,11rvukd,2023-03-15,IsraelPalestine,Two Anti-Zionists Speak Behind Closed Doors,"Two relatively well known Palestinian activists recently spoke, behind closed doors of course but on camera, about some of the beliefs the anti-Israel movement hold while pushing their hateful agenda. Today, we can all learn something.

First we have [Mohammed El-Kurd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_el-Kurd). Palestinian activist, featured once on Time’s 100, writer for the Nation currently. He has appeared on numerous American news programs and has hundreds of thousands of social media followers. He’s also praised the child soldiers who fought in the Second Intifada  and accused Israelis of being Nazis and eating the organs of Palestinians, so obviously that only increased his popularity in pro-Palestinian circles (in my opinion anyway).

[El-Kurd was recorded at a pro-Palestine](https://twitter.com/lilbuddymax/status/1633502153502334982?s=20) event in which he says the following on the topic of calling Israel apartheid:

> “The word itself as a word, I’m not even talking about the legal definition of the word ‘apartheid’, I’m not talking about the crime against humanity, I’m talking about the negative word that is ‘apartheid’ and the negative connotation it carries in the psyche of the public. I think it is capable and it has been engineering and establishing a cultural shift in the way people approach and think about Palestine. But I’m less concerned about the accuracy of the word. You know, me and my friends have these arguments about, like, ‘it’s settler colonialism,’ ‘It’s apartheid’, ‘It’s police brutality’, ‘it’s ethnic cleansing’, it’s ‘this, it’s ‘that.’ I don’t care. As long as there’s a conversation happening in which the villain is portrayed clearly, I think that’s good. 

In other words, El-Kurd doesn’t care about how accurate the smear is. He doesn’t care about whether or not Israel’s treatment of Palestinians is actually matching the definition of apartheid, or ethnic cleansing, or police brutality, or none of the above. It doesn’t matter. The only thing that matters is that Israel, “the villain”, is portrayed badly. For Palestine activists like El-Kurd, the only thing that matters is making Israel look bad, not the truth, and not accurate use of words. This is pretty consistent with almost anyone’s real life or online experiences interacting with Palestine activists. In my experience, they all feel essentially the same way. 

Next we have Omar Barghouti, the founder of the BDS movement, who resides happily in Israel. I trust he needs no further introduction than that. 

So [Barghouti made a statement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFl5abYmjOk) about the goals of BDS where he said the quiet part out loud. 

> Normalization is the participation in any project, initiative or activity, local or international, that brings together on the same platform, that brings together Arabs, including Palestinians, and Israelis, **whether institutions or individuals**, and does not meet the following two conditions, first, that the Israeli side publicly recognizes that the UN affirmed the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people, which are set out in the 2005 BDS rules, and the second condition is that the joint activity constitutes a form of co-resistance against the Israeli regime of occupation, settler colonialism and apartheid. Again, **Israeli side means Jewish Israelis or Jewish Israeli institutions such as the case may be.**

So Barghouti proves once again that BDS applies on an individual level, not an institutional level, despite the lies to the contrary you may have heard.

But he also shows that the rules of normalization, as he laid down, are only applicable to Jews. It is not ‘normalization’ to meet with Israeli Arabs or Israeli Druze, or any other group of Israelis, no matter how Zionist they are, other than Jews. But, as always, and no matter what they themselves say, BDS isn’t anti-Semitic.

**2. Ottoman Rule (1517-1917):**

   - During Ottoman rule, the land was part of a larger empire. In 1834, the Peasants' Revolt marked an early sign of Palestinian collective identity [➌](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peasants%27_revolt_in_Palestine#:~:text=Qasim%20and%20other%20local%20leaders,by%20the%20rebels%20and%20plundered) [➍](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Palestinians#:~:text=Kimmerling%20and%20Migdal%20consider%20the,against%20heavy%20demands%20for%20conscripts).

**3. British Control (1920-1948):**

   - The British took control post-World War I, with the Balfour Declaration in 1917 supporting a ""Jewish National Home"" in Palestine. Jewish immigration increased, especially post-World War II, leading to tension between Jewish and Arab communities [➎](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#:~:text=The%20Balfour%20Declaration%20of%201917%2C,of%20Israel%20in%201948) [➏](https://www.news18.com/explainers/israel-palestine-conflict-hamas-gaza-explainers-a-history-of-conflict-everything-you-need-to-know-8607845.html#:~:text=Here%20is%20a%20history%20and,the%20Jewish%20people%E2%80%9D%20in%20Palestine).

**4. Israel's Birth and Arab Loss (1948):**

   - Israel was established on May 14, 1948. While a moment of joy for Jews, Arabs faced violence and loss, calling this day Nakba (Catastrophe). Over 700,000 Palestinian Arabs fled or were expelled, and many ended up stateless or in refugee camps. Notable violent incidents included the Deir Yassin massacre where many villagers were killed [➐](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Palestinian_expulsion_and_flight#:~:text=In%201948%20more%20than%20700%2C000,9) [➑](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/5/15/nakba-mapping-palestinian-villages-destroyed-by-israel-in-1948#:~:text=On%20April%209%2C%201948%2C%20Zionist,110%20men%2C%20women%20and%20children) [➒](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Palestine_war#:~:text=During%20the%20war%2C%20around%20700%2C000,and%20in%20refugee%20camps).

**5. Ongoing Violence:**

   - The conflict didn't end in 1948. Violence and displacement continued, with more than half of the pre-1948 Arab population being displaced again during Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza in 1967 [➓](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-11104284#:~:text=In%20the%20course%20of%20Israel%27s,Today%20there).

**6. A Two-Faced Coin:**

 - It's pivotal to recognize that both parties have committed atrocities. Israeli government actions like settlement expansions, military operations, and blockade of Gaza, juxtaposed against Palestinian factions' rocket attacks and suicide bombings, reflect a narrative of mutual aggression and retaliation.

**7. Today's Struggles:**

   - Palestine seeks recognition as a state and freedom from control, while Israel desires security and recognition. The continued violence makes peace challenging.

**8. Views from Nearby:**

   - Middle Eastern countries have varied views. Some support Palestine, while others have ties with Israel. The region's politics are complex and impact the situation.



---

The Israeli-Palestinian conflict isn't black and white; it's a mosaic of grey, each piece narrating a story of hope, despair, courage, and fear. As we grapple with the present, may we strive for a future where peace triumphs over discord.

This is a simple dive into a complex issue. There's much more to learn and understand. Let's keep our discussions respectful and aimed at learning from each other.

Stay safe. 🙏🏼

# Further info following the comments:


**1. 1947 Violence and Mutual Hostilities**:


  - As the UN proposed the partition plan in 1947, violent hostilities escalated between Jewish and Arab communities within Palestine, leading to a cycle of mutual violence where both sides suffered casualties and engaged in retaliatory attacks.


**2. 1967 Six-Day War**:


  - In this crucial conflict, Israel faced off against Egypt, Jordan, and Syria, capturing significant territories including the Gaza Strip from Egypt, and the West Bank and East Jerusalem from Jordan, resulting in further displacement of Palestinians.



**3. Gaza's Ownership**:


  - Gaza was under Egyptian control until 1967. Post the Six-Day War, it came under Israeli control until 2005, with Israel continuing to control its borders, airspace, and waters, impacting the living conditions and governance within Gaza.



**4. Arab Nations' Involvement**:


  - The Arab nations, including Egypt, sought to challenge the establishment of Israel post-1947 UN partition plan, culminating in military confrontations like the 1967 Six-Day War, which significantly altered the territorial and political landscape of the region.



**5. 1947 UN Partition Plan and 1949 Armistice Agreements**:


  - The UN's 1947 plan aimed to create Jewish and Arab states but led to Israel's establishment without the creation of a Palestinian state, causing dissatisfaction among Palestinians and leading to the 1949 armistice agreements that formalized Israel's territorial gains.",FloydianCrazyDiamond,t2_5izjms4s,0.89,58,24

1046,17lj01c,2023-11-01,IsraelPalestine,Why are so many people supporting Palestine?,"The amount of antisemitism I've been seeing online is scary. So many posts have been calling for the destruction of Israel as a state and the death of the Jewish people. Why are so many supporting this? Israel is the victim in all this, and their citizens were hunted down and killed, and now that Israel defends itself, many people are getting angry and screaming genocide, as if Palestine isn't trying to kill every single Jew. We know they want to kill them all; why do we support them? Israel has also given the LGBTQ community every right they could need, but Palestine kills gay people. Look at this quote from Wikipedia:

  
""In February 2016, Hamas, which claims control of the Palestinian National Authority and rules Gaza, executed by firing squad Mahmoud Ishtiwi—one of the group's leading commanders—for homosexual activity.""

  
I've seen many in the LGBTQ community support Palestine, but why would they? Palestine has given the death penalty for being gay; why are we supporting them? We need to support Israel in their fight against Hamas, which is supported by the Palestinian people. It's hard to feel bad for civilian deaths when they voted Hamas into power, knowing their goal was the extermination of every Jew in the first place. Israel even warned the citizens of Gaza to evacuate, but Hamas is hiding among them and forcing Israel's hand.

1047,10kb7wc,2023-01-24,IsraelPalestine,The Cruelty is the Point,"*I recently read [an article in the Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/10/the-cruelty-is-the-point/572104/) about how for Donald Trump and his supporters, the presidential race etc. transitioned beyond political debate into taking pleasure at the pain and discomfort Trump caused his political opponents. I realized this same transition took place for Palestine and its supporters, so I wrote the below piece paraphrasing the Atlantic article and adapting it. Enjoy!*

The Museum of African-American History and Culture is in part a catalog of cruelty. Amid all the stories of perseverance, tragedy, and unlikely triumph are the artifacts of inhumanity and barbarism: the child-size slave shackles, the bright red robes of the wizards of the Ku Klux Klan, the recordings of civil-rights protesters being brutalized by police.

The artifacts that persist in my memory, the way a bright flash does when you close your eyes, are the photographs of lynchings. But it’s not the burned, mutilated bodies that stick with me. It’s the faces of the white men in the crowd. There’s the photo of the lynching of Thomas Shipp and Abram Smith in Indiana in 1930, in which a white man can be seen grinning at the camera as he tenderly holds the hand of his wife or girlfriend. There’s the undated photo from Duluth, Minnesota, in which grinning white men stand next to the mutilated, half-naked bodies of two men lashed to a post in the street—one of the white men is straining to get into the picture, his smile cutting from ear to ear. There’s the photo of a crowd of white men huddled behind the smoldering corpse of a man burned to death; one of them is wearing a smart suit, a fedora hat, and a bright smile.

Their names have mostly been lost to time. But these grinning men were someone’s brother, son, husband, father. They were human beings, people who took immense pleasure in the utter cruelty of torturing others to death—and were so proud of doing so that they posed for photographs with their handiwork, jostling to ensure they caught the eye of the lens, so that the world would know they’d been there. Their cruelty made them feel good, it made them feel proud, it made them feel happy. And it made them feel closer to one another.
This cruelty is present in other locations too, including one that we all know and are familiar with: [Palestine](https://img.haarets.co.il/bs/0000017f-e56a-d97e-a37f-f76f36520000/72/39/71330a977c8cc3928bacf20549b1/2882452659.jpg?precrop=2194,1275,x0,y335&height=630&width=1200&watermark=hdc-2021)

The pro-Palestinian movement is such a whirlwind of cruelty that it can be hard to keep track. Any actual interest in “human rights” or the best interests of the Palestinians was abandoned a long time ago in favor of hate, cruelty, and harassment. In the last six months alone, this one small subreddit has covered so many examples of pro-Palestinians harassing Jews and Israelis and beyond, from [an author who merely wanted to visit Israel](https://www.jpost.com/bds-threat/article-720758) to [Berkeley students banning “Zionists.”](https://www.chronicle.com/article/yes-berkeley-is-discriminating-against-jews) Even [Holocaust survivors](https://www.jpost.com/diaspora/antisemitism/article-717340/) [Orthodox Jews](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZCa2qdyHNk) and [innocent Jewish shoppers](https://twitter.com/MelissaLantsman/status/1542924614296289280) weren’t spared the sneers and jeers of those who call themselves “pro-Palestine.” Most recently, we discussed how [the NUS in the UK is full of examples of cruelty toward Jews at the hands of pro-Palestinians.](https://www.thejc.com/news/news/nus-inquiry-brands-student-union-hostile-environment-for-jews-10g0G1VtbfW7tFpFPxxfGm)

In the infamous anti-Semitic subreddit /r/PublicFreakout, [tens of thousands of people took great joy in mocking](https://np.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/kx6uxt/audience_member_tries_to_paint_dr_norman/) a young female student rightfully offended to the point of tears by Norman Finkelsteins’ insistence on comparing Israeli Jews to Nazis. The clip is from 2003 but gets reposted on Reddit every few years so that Israel haters can engage in a circlejerking orgy of hatred for one of their favorite targets. The student was brought to tears by Finkelsteins’ hateful rhetoric, but the Redditors had nothing but contempt:

“sick burn on the little grief addict in the audience.”

“It's disingenuous, but fundamentalists of every religion have learned that fake outrage and sadness is how you get what you want, especially when you can use six million dead bodies as a cudgel to argue for killing more innocent people.”

“Why tf is she having a nervous breakdown lol truth hurt that much.”

I could go on, but you get the point. Even those who believe that this girl was “faking it,” or was overreacting would see that in any other context for any other minority group that the mocking of her pain renders all minorities on campus collateral damage…maybe. Anyone afraid of speaking out, afraid that she would not be taken seriously, can now look to these pro-Palestinians to see her fears realized. Once malice is embraced as a virtue, it is impossible to contain.

The [cruelty of the actual Palestinian administration’s policies](https://mako.co.il/pride-news/local/Article-0af1b43124ca381026.htm), and the ritual rhetorical flaying of their targets before their supporters, are intimately connected. As Lili Loofbourow wrote of the Brett Kavanaugh incident in Slate, adolescent male cruelty toward women is a bonding mechanism, a vehicle for intimacy through contempt. The white men and the Palestinian men in the lynching photos are smiling not merely because of what they have done, but because they have done it together.

We can hear the spectacle of cruel laughter throughout the pro-Palestine movement. [One of the most iconic images of Palestine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_Ramallah_lynching) is a young man raising his bloody hands with a huge smile on his face, having completed the act of lynching a middle aged Israeli man. There were those who accused Palestine’s victims of being [mentally deficient](https://i.redd.it/0847fx227f491.png) merely for speaking out, not merely in cartoons but in [high production music videos too.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyXD_Kq3q4U) [They take great joy](https://old.reddit.com/r/Israel_Palestine/comments/z91qnn/cinema_viewing_recommendation_for_pro_israel/) in Israelis not wanting to be demonized in a Netflix movie that makes no claims to be a true story and yet is taken as gospel truth by pro-Palestinians anyway. 

And at every pro-Palestine rally, even as the rhetoric gets more [hateful and violent](https://www.foxnews.com/story/protester-calls-for-jews-to-go-back-to-the-oven-at-anti-israel-demonstration), the people chanting it just gets happier and happier. [Look at their faces, they’re having a great time.](http://zombietime.com/gaza_war_protest/IMG_8604.JPG) Pro-Palestinians [were overjoyed](https://www.kveller.com/people-celebrated-gerald-butlers-house-burning-down-because-he-supports-israel/) when they learned Friend of the IDF Gerard Butler’s house had burned down. [Protesters screamed at a pianist trying to perform for an audience, his only crime being born in Israel](http://www.algemeiner.com/2013/04/26/bds-belligerent-disruptive-and-silly/) and chanted [“Shoot the Jew”](http://witsvuvuzela.com/2013/08/30/with-video-audio-habib-calls-anti-semitic-song-irresponsible/) outside of another performer’s venue. The author Philip C. Winslow has an [anecdote that sums it up:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victory_for_Us_Is_to_See_You_Suffer)

>Ami Ayalon, a peace campaigner and member of the Knesset, was asked if he stood by his oft-quoted remark that the Palestinians and the Israelis hate each other. ""I cannot say that I hate Palestinians, but I think, as a nation, as a society, yes, most Israelis hate Palestinians and most Palestinians hate Israelis... I had a very interesting meeting in London during the intifada. A Palestinian friend approached me [and said]: 'Ami, we won. We Palestinians won.'... I asked him, 'Are you crazy? What do you mean ""We won""? You are losing so many people... and we are losing so many people. What is the whole essence of victory?' He said, 'Ami you don't understand us. **Victory for us is to see you suffer. This is all we want.** 

It isn’t just the Palestinians who feel that way, their supporters do too. Maybe this is their way of dealing with the fact that they won’t be able to destroy Israel, they’re settling for making their ‘enemies’ suffer. Taking joy in that suffering is more human than most would like to admit. Somewhere on the wide spectrum between adolescent teasing and the smiling Palestinian men in the lynching photographs are the pro-Palestinians whose community is built by rejoicing in the anguish of those they see as unlike them, who have found in their shared cruelty an answer to the loneliness and atomization of modern life.

The laughter undergirds the daily spectacle of insincerity, as the Palestinians and their apologists claim fealty to bedrock democratic, liberal principles they never had intention of respecting. The people who claim Israel floods Gaza with fictional dams and is releasing wild boars to kill Palestinians decry “false accusations” when SJP is reported to have created Jew-free zones in Berkeley; when student activists who fancy themselves victims of a ""Palestinian exception to free speech"" meet references to Jews whose only crimes was coming forward to offer their own stories of abuse with screams of “this is your brain on Zionism!” The political movement that bolsters a country which massacres civilians without a second thought, who encourages children to become martyrs for the cause, and who has murdered innocent people including families now laments Israel's inability to perfectly respect human rights.

This isn’t incoherent. It reflects a clear principle: Only the Palestinians and their allies, their  supporters, and their anointed are entitled to the rights and protections of the law and basic human decency, and if necessary, immunity from it. The rest of us are entitled only to cruelty, by their whim. This is how the powerful have ever kept the powerless divided and in their place, and enriched themselves in the process.

We discussed earlier this year how [Palestinian leaders live in luxury while their people suffer in poverty.](https://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/18763/gaza-suicide-hamas#.Yuo-Vm_7hnk.twitter) The stories are not unconnected. The Palestinian leadership have sought to enrich themselves at the world’s expense; they have attempted to corrupt the international legal system to protect themselves and their cohorts, and they have exploited the left’s darkest impulses in the pursuit of power. But their ability to get away with this fraud is tied to cruelty.

Palestine’s leaders’ only true skill is the con; their only fundamental belief is that the Middle East is the birthright of Muslim Arab men, and their only real, authentic pleasure is in cruelty. It is that cruelty, and the delight it brings them, that binds their most ardent supporters to Palestine, in shared scorn for those they hate and fear: immigrants, “Zionists,” Jews, “normalizers,” and treasonous Arabs who empathize with any of those who would steal their birthright. Palestine’s ability to execute that cruelty through word and deed makes them euphoric. It makes them feel good, it makes them feel proud, it makes them feel happy, it makes them feel united. And as long as Palestine makes them feel that way, they will let Palestine get away with anything, no matter what it costs them.",FederalFriend576,t2_mcu7fvjk,0.8,56,53

I do not condone the collective punishment of Gazans and my heart breaks thinking about the innocent people, 50 percent who are children, who are suffering because they were born into a circumstance. Same goes for Israelis, 1/3 of whom are children. We cannot hold civilians responsible for the actions of the people in power, or for a circumstance they were born into, or how history unfolded. This goes for both Israelis and Palestinians.

But genuinely - people who want a “Free Palestine”, what do you think this looks like and how do we logistically get there?

Hamas has genocidal intentions. Explicitly calls for the total destruction of Israel and annihilation of the Jewish people. If Israel were to lay down weapons + open their borders, and this is not propaganda, we would have Saturdays events happen again and again and again. That’s just the truth.

1051,17b5rid,2023-10-19,IsraelPalestine,What is the statute of limitations for getting land back?,"Most Americans now admit that Manifest Destiny, the ideology that led our ancestors to settle on Indian land and push them onto reservations, was immoral. Yet Americans, no matter how progressive, have no plan to hand over their own homes to Indians whose ancestors once lived there. Nor would any of us be willing to stop being part of the United States and accept Indian sovereignty over our towns. Not a single American would accept that. Too much time has passed for Indians to expect to undo 19th century injustices. White people born in America are not going to move elsewhere or change our government to accommodate descendants of wronged Indians.  
  
  
Palestinians say Jews had no right to form a country in Palestine, even though their distant ancestors had once lived there and been wrongfully evicted. Too much time had passed for Jews to undo their ancient misfortunes. Arabs who'd lived in Palestine for 1900 years should not have been expelled from their homes to make room for Jews.  
  


  
Maybe that’s right. Maybe Zionism had no more justification than Manifest Destiny. But Israel has existed for 75 years. Why should the current generation of Israelis have to move away or give up sovereignty to make room for descendants of Palestinians evicted decades before they were born?

First, I'll emphasize ""intentionally"". I will not debate that Israel's actions have led to the death of Palestinian babies, but I will argue that there is a difference between actions that unintentionally lead to death and those where the death is intentional. 

Imagine yourself holding a weapon and aiming it at a baby. Seriously, for anyone to hold that aim and kill the baby, they would need to view that baby as inhuman.

Think about what it would take for you to kill a mother and seize her baby as a hostage, threatening to kill it.

Think about what it would take for you to do the same to elderly adults, who may not even have the capability to stand up, let alone resist you.

Now most of the time when I look into it it's someone with no ties to the area, a random leftist European or a Muslim that basically hasn't set foot in either Israel or Palestine.

So my question is wether most of you guys are actually in either of those countries or just get your info from books or the internet?

Civilians who’s lives were way harder than mine to begin with, now homeless, the little they owned blown to rubble.

Everyone knows lots of Palestinian victims are hit by Hamas misfires and other mistakes; and those hit by Israeli weapons are many times victims of being forced to stand and wait for the missiles to hit them at gunpoint by Hamas people. 
And even those that were not harmed as above are nonetheless facing Israel’s weapons only because of Hamas’s terrorism, one way or another.


Hamas has been exposed so many times for torturing and killing Palestinians. https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2015/05/gaza-palestinians-tortured-summarily-killed-by-hamas-forces-during-2014-conflict/

&#x200B;

The reality is that Israel cannot make peace that she so desperately wants because the Palestinian regime has indoctrinated its youth to wage war against Jews. Peace cannot be made with a population that encourages children to become martyrs for Palestine. The longer the Palestinians reject solving the conflict with Israel, the more it becomes intractable.

&#x200B;

Instead of making genuine efforts to find creative solutions for peace, Palestinian schools propagate the destruction of Israel and murdering Jews. Rather than investing in superior education, the Palestinians are militarizing their youth. The Palestinian leadership’s educational emphasis is focused on blaming Israel and Jews for Palestinian misfortune. Billions of aid dollars from the USA, EU and UN is pocketed by corrupt Palestinian officials. Arafat died a billionaire. Abbas is worth at least $100 M.

If one wonders how a Palestinian teenager, a child soldier, could set out from his home to murder any identifiable Jew, a peek into UNRWA, PA and Hamas textbooks can explain.

* Curriculum **omits discussion of peace education** in the context of the conflict with Israel. Peaceful resolution as the ultimate goal isn’t taught.
* **Jewish history, such as the Holocaust, are presented as falsified.**
* **Jewish holy places are presented as Muslim areas** usurped by Zionists.
* Israel's existence is characterized as an **act of racist aggression** against the Palestinians.
* There is **no mention of Jewish historical roots** in the land.
* Grade 3 textbook reads: “Jerusalem is an Arab city built by our Arab ancestors thousands of years ago. Jerusalem is a holy city to Muslims and Christians,” – denying a Jewish connection to Jerusalem.
* **Math problems include examples of shooting Jews:** “One of the settlers \[Israelis\] shoots at \[Palestinian\] cars that pass on one of the roads. If the probability of his hitting a car in one shot is 0.7, and the settler shot at 10 cars, what will you expect to be the number of cars that were hit?” [https://www.jpost.com/arab-israeli-conflict/comprehensive-report-reveals-endemic-hate-education-in-palestinian-schools-632057](https://www.jpost.com/arab-israeli-conflict/comprehensive-report-reveals-endemic-hate-education-in-palestinian-schools-632057)
* Textbooks include **tropes that Jews control the world**, using classic Antisemitic cartoons and imagery.
* Students are presented with the **Antisemitic canard that Jews control money, the media, and politics, and are characterized as sinful liars and fraudsters.**
* Students are taught that **Jews turned against the Prophet (Muhammad) in early Islam**.
* Jews are described as “**the enemies of Islam** in all times and all places.”
* It teaches that **Jews are corrupt and are doomed to extinction** as their “corruption of the land will be the cause of their annihilation.”
* An emphasis is placed on **Martyrdom on the killing of infidels, which is glorified.** It stresses that **those who die as martyrs (shahids) while killing Christians and Jews, will go to paradise**, where Allah will raise their status.

A Palestinian child cannot go through the Palestinian school system without concluding that murder of Israelis is heroic.

1056,12szdp5,2023-04-20,IsraelPalestine,Jew Hatred Returns to Germany,"Less than a generation after World War II, Germans are back on the streets of Berlin chanting ""Death to Jews.""

> Berlin police are investigating a pro-Palestinian rally where demonstrators allegedly chanted “Death to the Jews” and “Death to Israel,” phrases that if verified could be criminal offenses under Germany’s strict post-World War II hate speech laws. Hundreds of people showed up in the Kreuzberg and Neukölln neighborhoods on Saturday at a rally organized in response to the police clashes with Muslim worshipers at the Temple Mount and Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem last week. In video captured by a watchdog called Democ, many were also shown praising Hamas, the terrorist group that rules the Gaza Strip.

Germany has one of the most stringent anti-hate speech laws in the world, for obvious reasons that we don't need to get into. Nevertheless, hundreds of quote on quote ""pro-Palestinian"" demonstrators still felt free to chant ""Death to Jews"" in Berlin. Of all the places in the world to chant that particular phrase, it's pretty amazing they chose Berlin to hold their rally.

But it's not all bad news! [Germany actually enforced their laws](https://www.jpost.com/bds-threat/article-739299) and these demonstrators actually suffered some consequences for their hate.

> The authorities in the city-state of Berlin banned protests on Saturday and Sunday, organized by the Israeli government-designated terrorist NGO Samidoun that aids Palestinian terrorists.

No doubt we will be hearing from pro-Palestine advocates worldwide about this latest example of ""silencing Palestinian voices"" and how the ""Zionists occupy"" the German government. 

The Jerusalem Post also had a little more information about the group that organized these protests:

>The protest was organized by Samidoun, a Palestinian NGO that has been classified as a terrorist entity by Israel. According to Israel’s The National Bureau for Counter Terror Financing (NBCTF), “The Samidoun organization was designated as a terrorist organization as it is part of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) and was founded by members of the PFLP in 2012.”

I find it interesting that this group is part of the PFLP, because the PFLP is very popular on Reddit (specifically r/Palestine) because it advocates for a secular one-state ""solution."" I wonder if the group will lose any popularity now that some of its supporters have been revealed to be pretty blatant anti-Semites. Unlikely, but you never know.

I’d previously posted two other entries:

In short, in no academic discipline is the idea that any significant number of Jews anywhere in the world are descended from Khazars considered credible.

I originally promised that the **fourth post**, focused on myths surrounding Palestinian Arab ancestry, would come out the following day. Spoiler: it didn’t. Events and COVID got the better of me, so here it is, three months later.

# Overview

This topic is a big, broad, and fuzzy one; if you see folks making sweeping, categorical statements that aren't hedged around with words like, ""primarily"", ""mostly"", ""likely"" or ""the evidence suggests,"" odds are that they *do not know what they're talking about.* They're describing a region with 3,000 years of history and 10,000 years of archaeology, that sits at the absolute center of historical migration and trade routes; it's going to be convoluted.

Over time, there have been immigrations and intermarriage among Palestinians (just as with the Jews), but not to any particularly greater extent. Bluntly, if Ashkenazi Jews can claim to be descended from ancient Levantines, then so can Palestinians.

It’s very compelling for pro-Israel folks to believe that Palestinians are generally the descendants of Arab invaders, or Egyptian migrants. They point to their Arab identity and go, “See????” That doesn’t make it true, and I’ll break down why by addressing each proposition in turn.

Here are the four myths I'll be addressing:

**This historical and linguistic arguments:**

* Palestinians are Arabs, and Arabs are all from Arabia
* Palestinians are descended mainly from the Muslim conquerors
* Palestinians are primarily descended from 19th and 20th century immigrants

**The genetic argument:** Palestinians cluster with Arabians, or Egyptians, or North Africans, etc., and therefore are not indigenous / not descended from Levantines.

# The Historical And Linguistic Arguments

I’m not going to get into the ‘Palestinian identity’ … see the [first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/q8w3hd/palestine_propaganda_and_the_misuse_of_history/) for that. I’m going to focus on the history of the Arabs of Palestine, not the history of the Palestinian Arab identity. Let’s jump in.

**Myth 1: Palestinians are Arabs, and Arabs are all from Arabia.**

In its modern usage, ""Arab"" is an [ethnolinguistic group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabs) comprised of shared cultural, religious, and linguistic history -- it is not a description of genetics, ancestry, indigenousness, or race. It's analogous to ""Hispanic""; it covers a massive geography and range of people, and does not mean that you are predominantly descended from the inhabitants of Spain.

It’s certainly true that the Arab *language* originated in Arabia, and that it has long been associated with ethnic Arabians – but take a second, consider which countries are members of the [Arab League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_League) and the breadth of countries that are united by [pan-Arab nationalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan-Arabism) and ask yourself whether it is credible that every one of these peoples is primarily descended from Arabians. What happened to the people that lived in these places *before* their Arabization? What happened to the Egyptians and the Berbers and the Arameans and the Syrians?

The short answer is, “They’re still around, but they identify as Arabs.” Modern Egyptians are extremely closely genetically linked to ancient Egyptians, as are modern Berbers, etc.; Arabians added some of their genetics into the melting pots of the countries that adopted their identities, but the majority of the shift was from the [Arabization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabization) of the existing populations. Like the processes of [Hellenization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellenization#:~:text=Hellenization%20(other%20British%20spelling%20Hellenisation,and%20identity%20by%20non%2DGreeks.)) or [Persianization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persianization), Arabization was the adoption of the traditions, language and religion of the Arab conquerors by populations throughout the ‘Arab world’.

A study of history, genetics or linguistics will show the massive diversity and individuality of Arab populations – and their uninterrupted history extending into the past far beyond their Arabization.

**Myth 2: Palestinians are descended mainly from Muslim conquerors.**

This argument comes out much more frequently than the above, and usually from somewhat-more-educated folks. The argument is that, when the [Hejazi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hejaz) Arabs conquered Palestine, they displaced whatever existing population was there with Hejazi / non-Levantine Arabs.

There’s a kernel of truth here, but that kernel can be applied in a *very* misleading way. In brief, the historical evidence suggests Palestinians are primarily descended from *the people who were conquered*, not from conquerors from the Hejaz. That does *not* mean they were primarily descended from ""the Jews"", but it *does* mean they were likely descended from people that lived in-and-around the Herodian kingdom of Judea, and the subsequent Byzantine provinces in Palestine.

* The Roman [province of Judea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judaea_(Roman_province)) consisted of several regions (Judea, Samaria, and Idumea, along with the coast and hinterlands surrounding Caesaria, which had been under Hellenic rule until about a century earlier, and the Hellenic city of Gaza, rebuilt by Pompei around the same era). This was bordered by territories that had been added to the Herodian kingdom of Judea by conquest, but that the Romans chose to administer separately:
   * The [Decapolis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decapolis) and [Perea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perea) (Transjordan, with cities dominated by the Hellenic descendents of Macedonian settlers and by Nabataeans);
   * Gaulanitis (the Golan), populated by semi-nomadic [Itureans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iturea) (Arabs, or possibly Arameans).
   * The Galilee, which was primarily Jewish, but quite sparsely populated at the time (save for [Sepphoris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepphoris#Hellenistic_period;_Hasmoneans), a center of Roman culture and home to resettled Roman legionaries).
   * It's worth noting that, while all of the Herodian kingdom of Judea was nominally converted to Judaism under the rule of Herod the Great (72 BCE - 1 CE), only Judea had a long-term history of practicing Judaism and considering themselves to be ""Jews""; while Jews likely made up a great religious majority in this period, many of them would have been recently-Judaized Idumeans, Nabateans, Itureans, Pereans, and Samaritans.
* Until the 4th century, despite Roman genocide in the Jewish-Roman wars, Jews (that is, practitioners of Judaism) still [likely made up a majority](https://www.google.com/books/edition/An_Introduction_to_Jewish_Christian_Rela/87Woe7kkPM4C?hl=en&gbpv=1&pg=PA72&printsec=frontcover) in Palestine, along with the Samaritans; outside of Jerusalem and the surrounding Judean hinterland, there’s no evidence of a significant enough population collapse to suggest that the majority of Jews had been killed or expelled from the region as a whole.
* Rather, the center of Jewish life moved to Galilee (see [The History of Jews in the Greco-Roman World](https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_History_of_the_Jews_in_the_Greco_Rom/YBarWAR2qVkC?hl=en), p173), whose Jewish population exploded. Note that the Galilee had only one major city in the Herodian era, and was so Romanized as to actively fight on the Roman side during the first Jewish revolt ([Josephus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josephus) unsuccessfully besieged it).
* As the Roman empire [Christianized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianization_of_the_Roman_Empire) in the 4th century, Jews and Samaritans experienced increased political and social pressure to convert, and by the [end of the 5th century](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-ecclesiastical-history/article/abs/christianisation-of-rural-palestine-during-late-antiquity/6F76B1716F1A9BE209696596A5F5618E) Christians made up a majority of the population in Judea, Idumea, the Perea, Gaulitania, and the coast; Jews and Samaritans remained the majority in the Galilee, and Samaria.
* Starting in the third century and picking up in the 4th, the Christian [Ghassanid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghassanid) Arabs were invited by the Byzantines to take up the formerly-Nabataean territories in the south of Palestine (and to act as buffers against the Sassanians’ Arab vassals, the Lakhmids). These were hardly the first Arabs in Palestine (e.g., I mentioned the Iturians previously, or the Nabateans, who controlled much of modern-day Jordan, the Negev and Gaza in the 1st century BCE), but it certainly expanded the Arab population to some extent.
* These forces helped to quash three later rebellions in the Galilee and Samaria – two (in the late 5th and early 6th centuries) by the [Samaritans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samaritan_revolts), and [one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine%E2%80%93Sasanian_War_of_602%E2%80%93628) (in the early 6th century) by the Jews), both of which groups made up very large minority populations. This coincides with the wealthiest and most extensively populated period in the history of Palestine, until the 20th century (see [Palestine: A 4000 Year History](https://books.google.com/books?id=0mmYxQEACAAJ), p406) – over 1.5 million inhabitants.
* A Muslim army conquered Jerusalem in 638; according to contemporary Arab historians, the army was comprised of around 17,000 troops; quite famously, Caliph Umar ibn Al-Khattab [promised](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umar%27s_Assurance) (and in fact, delivered) safety and relative religious plurality to the people of Palestine. In other words … no massacre or genocide occurred.
* Unsurprisingly (as 17,000 troops, even terribly energetic ones, will not breed their way into an immediate demographic majority amidst a population of 1.5 million), in the first hundred years of Muslim rule the significant majority of the population remained Christian, Jewish or Samaritan. Even several hundred years later at the time of the first Crusade (see [The Tragedy of the Templars](https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Tragedy_of_the_Templars/5thHYgEACAAJ?hl=en)), Christians made up the majority of the population of Palestine, although Arabic was widely spoken as a *lingua franca.*
* The Mamluks (ruling Egypt, then Damascus) made the elimination of the crusader states (and the removal of the possibility of future crusades) a great priority; over the following two centuries of Mamluk rule, Islamization and Arabization of the territory was a high priority, with a focus on integration; it’s only during this period that we see Muslims become the majority. Again … without any genocide or waves of massive immigration.
* So the grain of truth here is that a) the Byzantines *did* introduce a significant Arab minority in the south to enforce their will and b) there certainly *was* immigration over time from the wider Arab world. Where it runs aground is that *there is simply no evidence of discontinuity.* Every generation we examine in the southern Levant was mostly descended from the *previous* generation that lived in the southern Levant, with the language and the religion changing to a *far greater extent* than the people.

**Myth 3: Palestinians are primarily descended from 19th and 20th century immigrants**

Although this one is less common, it’s an opinion I periodically see expressed on this subreddit and in articles like [this one](https://www.jpost.com/blogs/why-world-opinion-matters/are-arabs-the-indigenous-people-of-palestine-402785) on Israel-oriented media. The premise is that, while there *was* a substantial population of indigenous Arabic-speaking, Muslim people living in Palestine, by the 20th century they represented a minority of Palestine’s Arabs; the rest, the argument goes, immigrated to Palestine between the 1840s and the 1930s, primarily from Egypt and primarily in the last 20 years of that period.

Like the other arguments, this one relies on stringing together facts that, while independently accurate or semi-accurate, *do not support the conclusion.* Here are the facts in support of this premise:

* The border between Egypt and the southeast of Palestine has always been porous, with migration back and forth a frequent occurrence during times of war or famine; consider the [Egyptian military presence in Gaza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Gaza#Bronze_Age) (which lapsed and reoccurred repeatedly for over a thousand years), or the type of scenario described in the story of Joseph. Certainly, we’d expect (and have always *seen)* a certain amount of ongoing population exchange.
* During the 19th century, various histories and contemporary accounts describe immigration from Egypt (due a combination of military desertion during the [Egyptian-Ottoman wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian-Ottoman_War_(1831-1833)), migrant workers fleeing famine in Egypt, and workers fleeing forced labor projects).
* Demographers like David Grossman (see [Rural Arab Demography and Early Jewish Settlement in Palestine](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Rural_Arab_Demography_and_Early_Jewish_S/ArNBaNcahNIC?hl=en&gbpv=1&printsec=frontcover), p48-60) have used the frequency of distinctively Egyptian surnames to estimate that the highest shares of population are where we’d expect them to be (between Gaza and Jaffa), and peaked in the late 19th century.
* There *was* some degree of illegal immigration from Egypt, Syria, Lebanon and Transjordan during the British Mandate period, according to the several British studies that touched on the topic (the [Hope Simpson Enquiry](https://web.archive.org/web/20140810170235/http:/unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/E3ED8720F8707C9385256D19004F057C), [Passfield White Paper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passfield_White_Paper), and [Peel Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peel_Commission) report).
* The Arab population of Palestine grew an awful lot in less than two generations – from 670,000 to 1.2 million between 1922 and 1948. How, the argument goes, could such a rapid increase *not* be from immigration?

**However**, the vast majority of historians and demographers believe that 19th and 20th century immigration represented a modest addition to the Palestinian Arab population, not a massive increase. Here’s are some of the reasons why:

* Egyptian-era and Ottoman-era immigration was quite small relative to the Arab population of Palestine, using either surname-based analysis or the Ottoman 1905 census (in which only [1.7% of Palestinian Arabs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographic_history_of_Palestine_(region)#Late_Arab_and_Muslim_immigration_to_Palestine) had been born outside of Palestine).
* Both the various British studies mentioned above, and the Israeli Institute of Statistics (see [The Divided Economy of Mandatory Palestine](https://books.google.com/books?id=OdEryYxCKTMC&pg=PA72), p31) conclude that the great majority of the Arab Palestinian population increase was due to natural growth.
* The highest estimates (e.g., [here](http://www.meforum.org/522/the-smoking-gun-arab-immigration-into-palestine)) rely on improbably-large immigration figures and unreasonably-low estimates of population birth rate – but still produce a foreign-born share of only about 12% … meaning that in any case, at least 88% of Palestinian Arabs *were not* immigrants.
* Finally, Egyptian Arabs are genetically quite distinct from Levantine Arabs (from Palestine, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, etc) – were the *majority* of Palestinian Arabs to be descended from Egyptians (or even a very large *proportion* to be so descended), we ought to see the genetics of Palestinian Arabs be … well, a good deal more Egyptian; we do not.

With that, let’s go ahead and move on to the genetics part of the conversation.

# Arguments Based on Genetics

We laugh at the racial pseudo-science of previous generations, if we remember it at all – it’s a wild ride to read books by the likes of [Houston Stewart Chamberlain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Stewart_Chamberlain), a once best-selling author who made hay from exploiting 19th and early-20th century white supremacists’ desire to fundamentally misinterpret the scientific findings of their day to support their racist philosophies and politics.

In our own era, I’m convinced the equivalent will be the unfounded assertions people make based on genetic population studies in an attempt to preserve the idea of perfect, categorical “races” that are distinct from one another and can be neatly codified and pinned one or another spot on the map.

**How genetic analysis works.** I often have very frustrating arguments with folks who do not fundamentally understand *how* modeling approaches or tools like ADMIXTURE or Principle Component Analysis work, what their strengths and limitations are, or what is *actually* being modeled when someone writes an article describing ancestry or demography based on genetic analysis.

If you want to base your argument on this type of paper, that’s great! It’s incredibly interesting and exciting research – but I hope that you’ll take a moment to understand a little bit of what goes *into* those analyses, so that you’ll understand why the researchers themselves rarely make the type of sweeping statements that laypeople who read their papers might be inclined to.

With that goal in mind, I’ve written a [really-short, highly-oversimplified primer on the topic](https://www.reddit.com/r/testingbotsrightnow/comments/z89jc4/quick_crash_course_genetics_and_clustering/); if you’re not willing to take my word for the below, please take a sec and read it.

**After you've read that, let's get into the specific arguments.** I can’t tell you how often I am sent a link from some study or another that the user purports shows that “Palestinians cluster with Arabs” or “Palestinians are Arabians” or something along those lines – so I’m just going to straightforwardly make this statement, and back it up:

**The fact is, the vast majority of genetic studies that include Arab Palestinians conclude that they are quite closely related to other Levantines, including Jews.** Every study that I’m aware of that makes claims about *shared ancestry* makes the conclusion that Palestinians are *primarily* descended from, (or very closely related to descendants of), the ancient inhabitants of the Levant.

**Studies of modern populations’ relationships** show that Levantine people-groups are very closely related to one another:

* A[ 2010 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3032072/) of Jewish populations found that Jewish populations have the most genetic similarity with Palestinians, Jordanians and Druze – who in turn cluster more closely with one another, than with Arabian and North African populations.
* Another [2010 study](https://sci-hub.wf/10.1038/nature09103) corroborated the genetic relationship of various Jewish populations to one another – and show Palestinians and Jordanians, Druze and Lebanese as being closely related to one another, as well as to Jewish groups. “This inference underscores the significant genetic continuity that exists among most Jewish communities and contemporary non-Jewish Levantine populations.”
* A [2013 study](https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/2013%20study) of 1,341 Lebanese people (compared to 48 existing population groups) is often used by the poorly informed. This study concludes that Lebanese people are all very closely related to each other, to Jews, to Cypriots, to Palestinians, Syrians, and Jordanians – really unsurprising. It *also* shows that Lebanese Muslims are more closely related to Syrians, Jordanians and Palestinians than are Lebanese Druze and Christians, and suggests this has to do with relatively more fluidity in intermarriage among Muslims with the rest of the Muslim world, over the centuries. It does *not* say that Lebanese Muslims *aren’t* very closely related to Lebanese Christians and to Jews -- in fact, it says the opposite.
* Another [2013 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3543766/) found that the “closest genetic neighbors to most Jewish groups were the Palestinians, Israeli Bedouins, and Druze in addition to the Southern Europeans, including Cypriots. The genetic clusters formed by each of these non-Jewish Middle Eastern groups reflect their own histories of endogamy. Their proximity to one another and to European and Syrian Jews suggested a shared genetic history.”

**Studies of ancient DNA** show a great deal of continuity between modern-day and Bronze-Age Levantine populations:

* A [2017 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5544389/) of 99 modern-day Lebanese and genomes taken from skeletal remains from Middle Bronze Age Sidon shows that the majority of ancestry among present-day Lebanese people is derived from the population of Sidon, and estimates that additional Eurasian ancestry arrived in the Levant from 3,750 to 2,170 years ago.
* A [2020 study](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(20)30487-6?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0092867420304876%3Fshowall%3Dtrue) compared data from Bronze Age burials from the Southern Levant (in Jordan, Sidon, Israel, and Ashkelon) to the genomes of earlier Neolithic populations, and to present-day Jewish groups and Levantine Arabic-speaking groups. They demonstrated >50% shared ancestry for both Jews and Palestinians with the ancient Levantine groups.

Now, does the above prove that Palestinians are *all* descended from ancient Levantines? No, it doesn’t; but it shows that either they *were*, or that the people they *are* descended from were much more closely related to the ancient Levantines (and to modern Jews, Druze, and Lebanese) than to modern-day Saudi Arabians, or *any* North African population group.

# Too long; didn't read

Well, no shame in that -- it did run longer than I intended it to. Here's what you should take away:

* At every point in the past 2,000 years, the majority of the population of Palestine has been descended from people who already lived there; people emigrated and immigrated, but the historical evidence demonstrates that conversion and enculturation, not population displacement, changed the religious and linguistic nature of the population.
   * That does not mean ""Palestinians are all descended from Judeans!"" if that's your commentary, please re-read the above.
   * That does *not* mean ""Palestinians weren't genetically affected by admixture over time."" Unless you live on a remote pacific island, that doesn't happen.
* There certainly *was* immigration (to and from the Mediterranean world, to and from the Islamic world, and to and from the region's neighbors), but there is no evidence that immigration ever accounted for a majority of the population.
* The genetic evidence backs that up -- Palestinians sit in the genetic midpoint between other Levantines (like Jews and Lebanese), North Africans (like Egyptians and Algerians), and southern Arabians (like Yemenis, etc) ... which is exactly *where Palestine is.* And like Palestine's physical location, they tend to group most closely *with the rest of the Levant.*

So in summary: if you're attempting to deny Palestinian indigenousness based on the idea that they migrated somewhere else, it's bunk. Palestinians aren't all descended from immigrants to Palestine any more than Jews are descended from Khazars.

Edit: Folks, I'm not going to try and prove a negative here. If your argument is that it is *theoretically possible* that all of this evidence is incorrect, it sure heckin' is. Just about anything is theoretically possible. My position is that this stance is the *most reasonable one,* and if you'd like to disagree with it, please lay out your alternative hypothesis and we'll chat about it.",badass_panda,t2_9j5tu,0.85,56,100

1062,14cfj4s,2023-06-18,IsraelPalestine,BBC twisting the narrative is all too obvious,"As a Brit, I used to follow the BBC almost religiously. In the UK it's by far the most followed media outlet, and often settles arguments in the face of conflicting views. It's seen as a neutral representation of the world.

I grew to feel let down by media coverage of some of my experiences while in the British Army, particularly on how the war on drugs in central America is portrayed, and the conflicting and outright wrong articles published about Bahrain when I was serving there.

Since living in Israel and Palestine, I'll admit that my disappointment has turned to anger. We are amid one of the oldest and most interesting conflicts of our time, where narratives, cultures, religion, tactics and even goals are not only clashing, but completely asymmetrical. Yet media outlets across the World insist on putting out simplistic one-sided narratives, either in support of Israel or in support of Palestine, that only mislead people about the reality.

Falling short of actually spending some months living in Israel and Palestine, the next best thing are real statistics and indices out there to help us understand reality.

The Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research is a great source, and they just shared their [most recent survey](https://www.pcpsr.org/en/node/940). Understanding this can really help everyone worldwide understand the core challenges behind this conflict.

Yet the BBC then even uses THIS to post a simplistic, one sided, and demonizing [article](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-65812444) that ultimately just makes everything worse. Here is how they pull it off:

* **Selective democratic context.** The article goes into detail on how the PA and Hamas are authoritarian, with no elections. But fails to show context that Jordan, Syria, Egypt, Lebanon and virtually every other surrounding country, except for Israel, is an authoritarian regime as per the [global democracy index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Economist_Democracy_Index). For sure I wish democracy on Palestinians, but this lack of context makes it seem like a unique issue for them, with the clear implication that Israel is to blame.
* **Twisting of political cause and effect.** The article explains the risk of Hamas taking over power in the West Bank. Yet somehow the article suggests this violent trend of supporting Hamas and other armed militias ""which have carried out attacks in the West Bank against Israeli forces and settlers"" ( wording used to try to ignore the fact that these groups target civilians most of the time) is produced by Israel's occupation and by the lack of elections by the PA, when it's clear to me that it's the *cause* of the occupation and of the lack of elections, as the PA would rather be authoritarian than see Hamas in power, and Israel would rather continue this occupation than see Hamas in control of the West Bank.
* **Purposeful misrepresentation of identity.** The article explains how 20% of Israel's population are, quote, ""Palestinian citizens"", and implies they all long to be connected to the wider Palestinian identity, and that by law they are not allowed to travel to the West Bank. The clear implication here is that Israel is somehow holding them hostage? This is a new one for me. For one, we know that only [7% of Israeli Arabs](https://www.jpost.com/arab-israeli-conflict/only-7-percent-of-israeli-arabs-define-themselves-as-palestinian-625285) would call themselves ""Palestinian"".

The BBC clearly relied on the [PCPSR survey](https://www.pcpsr.org/en/node/940) I shared above for most of this article, and mentions it directly as a source. However they chose not to share a link to it... Because anyone that reads the survey itself will get a very different idea of the reality of this conflict.

All they mention from the survey is:

>The findings demonstrate clear trends in this generation's declining support for the governing Palestinian Authority (PA) and a consistent drop in support for a two-state solution over the last decade.

And fail to bring up any of the other findings, such as:

* Hamas, Islamic Jihad and the Intifadas are seen in Palestine as the ""Most positive developments since the Nakba"".
* Only 9% of Palestinians favor seeking a political solution to the conflict, as opposed to armed conflict. 66% hold the belief that Israel will not endure another 25 years.
* 71% of Palestinians are ""in favor of forming armed groups such as the Lions' Den and the Jenin Battalion"".
* 71% of Gazans have a positive perception of their safety and security, but 84% of Palestinians believe the PA to be corrupt, and 73% believe Hamas to be corrupt.
* 70% of Palestinians oppose the two state solution, which has never risen above 53%.

So my conclusion is that the BBC here is actively trying to hide context in order to portray a narrative. Instead of showing the real results of this survey, or getting accurate representation of Israeli Arabs, they instead are very selective with the data they share and the interviewees they choose.

My main question is: WHY?

Why does the BBC care so deeply about portraying a certain image about this conflict, even it's so clear they've gone to enormous lengths to do so?

For context: I'm not Jewish, Israeli, Palestinian, Arab or Muslim. I'm British, and have lived and worked in both the West Bank and in Israel so far.",Conscious_Spray_5331,t2_dgcsdxmx,0.77,53,88
1063,14s68of,2023-07-06,IsraelPalestine,Is it reasonable to expect Israel to care more about the lives of Palestinians than Palestine Does?,"The latest Jenin raid got me thinking about a topic I’ve been considering for a while.

For literally decades, Palestine has treated its women and children as combatants and tools for fighting its war with Israel. You can read here in [this article from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children_in_the_Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict) under the section “Palestinian militant misuse of children” many examples of that. Amnesty International, who loathes Israel, said it better than I can:

> ""Palestinian armed groups have repeatedly shown total disregard for the most fundamental human rights, notably the right to life, by deliberately targeting Israeli civilians and by using Palestinian children in armed attacks.""

Palestine used [International Women’s Day to honor four female terrorists](https://www.timesofisrael.com/female-terrorists-become-palestinian-role-models-on-international-womens-day/) and people like Rasmea Odeh and Leila Khaled are so revered for their terrorist activities they’re invited to speak at college campuses worldwide. 

I’m old enough to remember when the Great March of Return was happening in Gaza, and [children were pushed right](https://twitter.com/Jtruzmah/status/1044347092498444289) into the front lines, to the point where [a baby allegedly died from choking on tear gas.](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/8-month-old-dies-protests-israel-palestine_us_5afabdc5e4b044dfffb5c420) The narrative of the Great March of Return was that the evil Israeli army was gunning down any Palestinian who approaches the fence, nevertheless, Palestinian children were out there every single day approaching the fence.

The same thing is happening now with Jenin. Some of the militants killed there (and Palestine doesn't even pretend that they weren't militants) were 16 and 17 years old, making them children by the UN's definition. They were armed and trained to kill, and sent into battle against armed soldiers, and surprise surprise, some of them got killed. 

So the question that has been on my mind, for years at this point, is that why should Israel and the rest of the world care more about the lives of Palestinians, including Palestinian children, than Palestine and its supporters care? 

Palestine, by which I mean Hamas and Fatah, the current representatives of Palestine, considers women and children, especially children, as military assets to be used in the war against Israel. I’ve proven that above. So Palestine and its supporters can’t have it both ways. They can’t unapologetically deploy child soldiers and human shields and then scream and cry and wring their hands when those children are killed in violent altercations. If Palestine genuinely cared about its children, it would protect them and keeps them out of harm's way. That's what Israel does. That's what Ukraine does. That's what every other country other than Palestine does. 

Remember, the narrative among anti-Zionists is that Israel is a genocidal apartheid state. If Palestine and its supporters actually believed that was true, then it’s even worse that Palestine is using child soldiers and human shields, since presumably if Israel was so genocidal the human shields wouldn’t actually shield anything and there would be no chance of the human shields living through the encounter. 

If Palestine thinks it’s winning the war of public opinion when it sends children up to the Gaza fence and one of them gets shot, it’s wrong. Logical, honest people look at a situation like that and ask the obvious question: why are children anywhere near a militarized border? And Palestine and its supporters, as always, have no answer except to vomit hatred at Israel. 

I'm not going to dance to Palestine's tune and wring my hands and scream hatred at Israel when Palestinian child soldiers are killed in battle. It's just not going to happen. I care about Palestinian children a lot, apparently a lot more than Palestine and its supporters do, but I'm not going to close my eyes to the reality of the situation.",TracingBullets,t2_w8btvkv3,0.75,51,237
1064,17ttb4v,2023-11-12,IsraelPalestine,Just read a report that the hospital staff of Al-Shifa refused 200 liters of fuel from the IDF,"Israel said it would provide fuel for the hospital in the on going war, and so it left 200 liters (52 gallons) outside of the Al-Shifa hospital as the first delivery according to the staff. Keep in mind that the IDF said it delivered 300 liters, so already we have conflicting info. 

The concerning part is the staff refused the fuel on the grounds of “it’s not enough” which seems incredibly ridiculous to me, in a situation like that why would you ever in a thousand years willingly NOT use fuel given to you, to keep the lights on and to keep babies breathing? I understand it’s “not enough” to keep the hospital fueled indefinitely but still, fuel is fuel, in a time like this to refuse it under these grounds seems insane and just plain disingenuous 

So I have a hard time believing they refused it due to it “not being enough” I personally believe foul play is at hand with Hamas, I think it’s likely they either forced them to not accept the fuel, or stole it themselves. I don’t believe the staff they would willingly refuse it either way. If this is true, it should be just yet another nail in the coffin for the idea that Hamas are “freedom fighters for the people” 

I’m gathering all of this info from NBC so as of right now I’m not sure it’s 100% verified. Is there a angle I’m just not seeing here? What other reason could it be if not Hamas? 

Edit: the hospital claims it needs over 10000 liters of fuel per day to run (2661 gallons) I’m not an expert on fuel/generator logistics but that number seems unviable to meet even in none war time situations for Palestines infrastructure, if I’m wrong please correct me if that’s a realistic number

1067,zdu7yx,2022-12-06,IsraelPalestine,Farha: A Review,"I'm sure we are all tired of the Farha posts at this point but I decided to watch the movie myself to get a better understanding of the controversy surrounding it and to have the ability to break it down for those who haven't seen it.

Before getting into the context of the film itself, I do want to talk about how it is presented to the audience. In the movie the director cleverly blends between historically accurate events and pure fiction at a pretty significant ratio. This is done so the average uninitiated viewer will see the movie as believable and not reject it immediately as pure propaganda by slowly easing you into the story with plausible scenarios before abandoning all historical accuracy with the introduction of the Israeli forces. In addition, the story as a whole is presented in a way that paints the Palestinians as victims by lying to the viewer through omission. People who have studied the conflict would catch onto this right away but then again they aren't the target audience.

The movie starts out with text that states the story is ""inspired by true events"" before stating ""Farha (whose name is Radiyyeh in the original events) made it to Syria, where she shared her story, keeping it alive for generations to come."" at the end of the film. This text is intentionally misleading as Radiyyeh's ""story"" isn't actually included in the film despite trying to imply that it is. In reality, her version of events are likely very different from what we see in the film especially when we take into account that the director admitted that [she never ever met with Radiyyeh or heard her story](https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/zca6i2/farha_director_admits_she_never_met_with_the/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) (besides that she was locked up in a room). The director then continues to say that she was happy that she never heard what actually happened because it gave her more freedom to add ""fiction"" to the movie.

The film starts out in a Palestinian village with short depictions of Palestinian daily life and scenes which help us get to know the girl and her aspirations to go to school in the city in order to become a teacher. It takes up 22 minutes of the film and is largely insignificant (besides for the storytelling aspect) without further analysis. The most important character here is Farha's father, the mayor of the village. Besides a scene where he is talking with Farha's uncle about the war and fighting back against the Zionists, he is seen conversing with a group of armed Palestinian militants (possibly part of the [Army of the Holy War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_of_the_Holy_War)) in which he advises them to wait for the invading Arab armies to arrive with troops and ammunition after which he would lead them into battle. In yet another scene, we see him fixing a wall with mud. He tells Farha that it keeps the stones from falling out but later we see the rocks have been removed revealing a hole in the wall that a rifle was hidden in. Near the end of the film we also see a handgun hidden in a sack of food in the cellar where Farha was hiding.

While these may seem like rather insignificant details to most people, we can safely assume that the village in the movie was one of the many that attacks against Israeli population centers were carried out from or at the very least, one which facilitated said attacks considering that the mayor was collaborating with the Palestinian militants and hiding arms in the village. Villages that were neutral and/or did not engage in warfare against Israelis were spared while ones that didn't (such as the village depicted in this film) were cleared out to prevent them from being used as outposts by Palestinians and their Arab allies. The Palestinian militants who were talking with the mayor left in a hurry and likely staged an attack on Israelis which resulted in the raid during which the village was captured later on in the film.

23 minutes into the film we hear explosions and Israelis on a loudspeaker in Arabic telling civilians to leave as well as which way to go to get out safely. We also see a group of Palestinian militants running through the village presumably to attack the Israeli forces who had just arrived. As stated in the previous paragraph, this again shows that the village was not only populated only by civilians but by Palestinian militants as well. During the attack the mayor takes his rifle from its hiding place before locking Farha in the cellar and going off to fight the Israelis.

Besides occasional sounds of gunfire and explosions, most of the cellar scene isn't particularly interesting until 50 minutes into the film where a Palestinian family (a husband, his pregnant wife, and two children) run into the courtyard. The woman gives birth to a baby boy and Farha calls out to the husband to free her from the cellar. Before he can open the door, the loudspeakers start up again telling Palestinians to come out in the open and surrender or they will be killed. At this point, Israeli soldiers and a Palestinian prisoner with a hood on pull up to the house. They see the husband and accuse him of hiding weapons in the house. After a quick search of the building, no weapons are found but they do find his wife.

This is the point where the movie turns ""fiction"" up to 100%. The officer threatens to cut open the woman's belly to find out if the baby is a boy or a girl. They then find the children hiding with the baby and have them, along with their parents, stand against a wall where they are shot to death. The baby survives and the commander tells one of the soldiers to ""finish it"" and ""not waste a bullet on it"". The soldier is about to step on the baby and crush his skull but then decides to cover it with a rag and then leaves instead. The baby cries for a good portion of the rest of the film then stops. Farha finds a gun in a sack of food and uses it to blow the latch off the cellar door allowing her to escape. As she leaves the village you see the dead baby (either due to starvation or exposure) covered in flies. Obviously this part of the film is meant to portray Israelis as inhumane monsters and is a caricature of what Palestinians think of us despite there being no historical evidence of such an event happening. If people were wondering why the movie is depicted as a ""blood libel"" here's your answer.

Ultimately, that's the movie. You may ask why I bothered to have such an in-depth breakdown of a work of fiction but it's because too many people seem to be looking at the film as a documentary rather than what it really is, yet another example of Palestinian propaganda. That's not to say the majority of the events couldn't have happened, and I would even go as far as to say it's mostly historically accurate even if the story itself isn't true. My main issue primarily focuses on lies through omission (in which the Palestinians are portrayed as innocent rather than the aggressors by stripping out critical historical context) and the disgusting portrayal of Israeli forces in the film.

At the end of the day, Palestinians and their allies got what they wanted. A movie that makes us look worse than we really are in the eyes of people who don't know any better and something that will be used as justification for even more violence and harassment directed against innocent Israelis in the future.",CreativeRealmsMC,t2_g06f9,0.86,49,49

On November 7th, Gazans were recorded evacuating to the south, holding their hands up, IDs, or white flags, notice at 0:16 IDF tank was standing there, not firing at the civilians. There are more images from yesterday as well:

1069,123wfph,2023-03-27,IsraelPalestine,The inversion at the base of the Palestinian arguments,"Let's start with the facts. The state of Israel is an existing sovereign state that has existed for almost a century. The state of Palestine does not exist, nor it has ever existed as such. There was no Palestinian state that was invaded by Israel, Zionist, Jews or whomever. There was an Arab population and there is an Arab population that wants self determination and to have their own state that they want to call Palestine.

It is therefor the Palestinian side who needs to justify why the state of Palestine should exist and why it should be created in territory that is currently controlled by the state of Israel. I am not saying that there are no arguments to be made, I am saying that the burden of proof is on the Palestinian side.

However, Palestinian supporters imply that Israel invaded an existing Palestinian country ('Palestinian land') in 1967, and/or that the Zionists/Jews invaded an existing country in 1948 ('Palestine). It is noteworthy how the borders of what constitutes Palestine (or 'historic Palestine') have shifted to fit exactly the territory that Israel controls. No one demands Jordan to give territory it controls so it can be included in a Palestinian state. Moreover, Palestinian supporters imply that this supposed conquering of 'Palestinian land' is an ongoing recent event and not century old history. They go as far as saying that Israel is 'stealing' 'Palestinian land'.

With these false notions being normalized through countless claims, it is common to see the burden of proof being shifted to the Israeli side, demanding Israel to Justify its existence and demanding Israel to concede to all the Palestinian wishes as if their wishes are rooted in returning to a 'normal state of affairs' that existed before the state of Israel was created, in the same way that all the other countries in the middle-east were created on territories taken by the British and French from the Ottoman empire, which no longer exist.

It is difficult to maintain consistent sympathy when confronting so many misrepresentations of the current situation and the history of the conflict. Personally, I would be far more consistently sympathetic to Palestinians if they focused on saying that they wish for self determination and they desire to have a homeland in the place their families lived for generations rather than focus on denying the Jews what they are claiming for themselves and engaging in historical revisionism.",un_disc_over,t2_je2g1491,0.76,52,87

It would also bar the DHS from granting Palestinians temporary protected status or refugee status.

I urge you to show this to the rest of the people who claim to be pro Palestine.

&#x200B;

⁠When Germany lost portion of their land after WW1, which the same happened to: Italy, Greece, Ottoman Empire, the British and more. None of them called out and said we want our land back that’s ours and called occupation! But Palestinian do! Now let me remind you who lived in the area 400 and 500 years before Islam was even born! Cannan and Judea. Never Palestine! In 135 CE, after stamping out the province of Judea’s second insurrection, the Romans renamed the province Syria Palestina—that is, “Palestinian Syria.” They did so resentfully, as a punishment, to obliterate the link between the Jews and our land! But let’s fast forward and reach 1948 when the two-state solution took place. Us Jews after the WW2 and the HOLOCAUST, were more than happy with that because we get to live in a place, we called home after being slaughtered for being Jewish. The Arabs were not. They went to war against us with not 1 country behind them but 5! They’ve lost and we conquered that land! Now why is that okay for all the other countries throughout history to gain that control and why we don’t hear occupied territories?!  That wasn’t the only time that this took place. The same happen in 1956, 1967, 1973, 1982 and into the 1990’s and 2000’s. So, after all these attempted not only we didn’t want that land, but we also gave them some more so they can stop and try to attack us in between coffee breaks and night times.

&#x200B;

Now that you understand that Israel not only won over 6 wars and far stronger. We have yet to destroy or harm them viciously like they have done on this past Saturday of October 7th. I have personally had kids shooting at me and the easiest thing to do is to eliminate that threat.  but instead, we ducked down and waited for a 10-year-old to finish his magazine. Same goes to kids coming to IDF posts in Israel border with explosive belt on them (who the F does that and send kids to fight their wars and manipulate innocent lives) We have never killed kids or women the way they did this past Saturday! When we bomb a place that launched rockets into Israel, we give them warning and tell them to vacate, but Hamas tells them not to leave and use them as human shield and keep firing rockets. so, it’s either us or those monsters that hide behind old people and kids. Mind you these people can escape which some do. But afterwards Hamas catch them and butcher them and their family Members. Just search that in Gaza and you’ll see. So now for the first time in many decades, Israel won’t hold back, and it will release its full power. and whichever country who will come against us will get the same faith. So, Iran, Yemen, Iraq brings it! and we will be over a million strong and since we have no other country, we will be more than willing to die defending ours. As for the Hamas and their other terrorist friends we will make sure you get to meet your 72 virgins.

&#x200B;

So, before you pass judgment on Israel, imagine what would you do if your family and loved ones were targeted just for their religion and being and your sisters, daughters and mothers gotten raped in front of your eyes, and you’ve being forced to watch because you’re handcuffed and an AK47 to your head?! When less than that happened on Pearl Harbor and the Japanese attacked American soldiers and civilians and killed over 2,000 people. The USA launched an attack that shock the whole world and killed more than 200k people. 80 years past by and no one question them nor have the balls to attack the USA as a country face on. So, before you judge us understand that we have EVERY GOD GIVEN RIGHT TO LIVE IN PEACE AND WITHOUT CONSTANT LIFE-THREATENING EVENTS!""",Hedaaaaaaa,t2_7qvhyito,0.79,48,40
1074,15eqgpq,2023-07-31,IsraelPalestine,Israel is lucky,"I watched the Lex Friedman interviews with Bibi Netanyahu and with Yuval Harari.

It really brought to my attention that Israel really is so lucky that Palestine is incompetent.

Firstly- if Arabs were more competent at war there would be no Israel to speak of.


(Bibi said)
Next- despite what the western pro-Palestine propagandists will tell you- the dominant narrative / belief among Palestinians is not 2 states for 2 people. It is not living side by side with Jews. It is not peaceful coexistence.

The dominant Palestinian belief is 1 Arab state from the river to the sea. The main disagreement, this is the Hamas brand vs Fatah brand is wether a 2SS is an acceptable stepping stone between now and a total Arab takeover or not. And wether the optimal strategy to achieve total victory is violent resistance, civilian attacks and rockets, OR that the optimal strategy is political maneuvering, painting Israel as south-Africa and seeking for international actors to boycott/sanction, and pushing for a ROR to demographically destroy Israel over time.

(Yuval said as a retort to the word apartheid)
The problem is that this leaves them no moral ground to stand on. They can’t say Israel is like South Africa because 

1. The blacks in South Africa did not deny the existence of South Africa and did not seek to destroy South Africa, They had a very simple goal- they simply wanted to be equal citizens and the apartheid regime said no you can’t be equal citizens

2. Palestinians are different- many of them do not recognize Israel. And they’re not demanding to be citizens of Israel- they’re demanding to destroy and replace Israel.
If Palestinians adopted the same policy of black South Africans - “just give us citizenship to vote in Knesset” then Israe￼l would be in a difficult position.


As it stands now- even if you steelman the Palestinian case- and accept the myths that Israel is committing ethic cleansing- well that’s also what Palestinians say they want to do but are too weak and ineffective. So now it’s just a power struggle between he said she said.",RandySpammer,t2_gmukwnjuy,0.85,48,145
1075,14cnqcc,2023-06-18,IsraelPalestine,The sheer hypocrisy of the Palestinian Authority,"Recently, I read an article by the Times of Israel detailing Mahmoud Abbas' meeting with the Chinese premier, Xi Jinping. It covers economic and diplomatic ties that both the PA and China are pursuing. But the thing most of interest to me is Abbas' statement on the treatment of Uyghur Muslims in China.

Now, it's well known that the vast majority of Muslim countries either conveniently ignore China's treatment of their Muslim minority, tacitly support it or explicitly support it. Now, where does Abbas stand on it?

According to him, China's policies have “nothing to do with human rights and are aimed at excising extremism and opposing terrorism and separatism.” He also declared that ""Palestine resolutely opposes using the Xinjiang problem as a way of interfering in China’s internal affairs.”

Oh, the hypocrisy.

First of all, the fact that the Palestinian Authority thinks Israel is committing ""50 Holocausts"" against the Palestinian people, despite deaths of the I/P conflict not even breaching 100,000 over 50+ years of conflict, versus over 1 million people being thrown in ""re-education camps"" and forced to undergo horrific treatment from the guards, such as beatings, rape, forced sterilisation, abortions and labour.

Second, The PA claims that this is all done under the guise of ""countering terrorism and separatism"". The hypocrisy of a governing entity, who encourages terrorism through financial means to claim that this treatment of a minority should be done because of ""terrorism"" is beyond comprehension. Nothing Israel has ever done in the name of counter-terrorism has reached what the CCP is currently doing.

Third, the PA is no stranger to using issues to interfere in Israel's internal affairs. While it does this less than Hamas, there is no doubt that things like the Pay to Slay fund drive terrorism in Israel, interfering in it's internal affairs, and is likely the cause of the country's drift to the right. Ironic, due to the fact that the PA excuses the criticism of the treatment of Uyghurs as ""interfering in China's internal politics."" This ties into the PA's idea that the treatment of Uyghurs is to ""stop terrorism"". The PA claims to dislike terrorism, but has no issues inciting terrorists. I guess it doesn't count when it's against Israelis, right?

Finally, the Palestinian Authority likes to use Western definitions of oppression in their ""criticism"" of Israel, yet resolutely rejects those standards when they are applied to China. Yet more double standards.

This just proves the need for new leadership in the PA. Hopefully, someone with more liberal views than the rest of Fatah will take Mahmoud Abbas' place, but I'm not optimistic. It also proves how the current Palestinian leadership is nothing but a bunch of crooks who will happily sell their mothers into slavery in order to get rich and find easy allies, while sidestepping the importance of working out a properly defined peace with Israel.

1077,12ahlx9,2023-04-03,IsraelPalestine,Israel is not forced to oppress Palestinians.,"Israel today is in the position of power and domination, and such has the practically unfettered ability to decide the fate and conditions of Palestinians. Unfortunately this has most often resulted in the dis-enfranchisement, oppression and even murder of the Palestinians. 

Many Israeli's are nevertheless under the presumption that many of the restrictions and realities of the Palestinians are ""necessary evils"", that Israel is simply reluctantly doing what it must, and taking the last resort, in order to protect It's citizens and the Jewish people as a whole. Of course in many cases this just factually isn't true, those murdered, villages ethnically cleansed and children abused are often provably innocent and clearly posed no danger. 

Keeping that to the side though, I want to focus on the actions(or lack of action) that Israel could take today which would drastically reduce the oppressive dynamics, fulfil its international/legal obligations, raise Palestinian standard of living and build trust and genuine connection without at all endangering Israeli citizens, the Jewish diaspora, or even the Jewish majority and continued domination. Of course Israel will likely never willingly do any of these, my point though is that the conditions imposed on Palestinians are not necessary or unchangeable but an active willing choice by Israeli officials without reasonable safety/human rights justifications.

1) Starting with the obvious one, indefinitely stop all land expansion of settlements and approval of new settlements in the occupied west bank. Of course this would work towards fulfilling it's obligations under international law not to ""transfer, directly or indirectly, by the Occupying Power of parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies” [1](https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/en/customary-ihl/v1/rule130). But this would also address the concerns of Palestinians directly, improve their everyday lives whilst showing a real commitment to a 2ss. This would not present a security risk or challenge Israeli control or the Jewish nature of the state. On the contrary, it would relieve the expensive security liability of disconnected civilian outposts/colonies.

2) Return unused lands confiscated from Palestinians. Israel has used a variety of ""legal"" mechanisms to confiscate up to 75% of west bank lands. From declaring all unregistered, communal or waqf land as ""state"" land, to declaring knowingly populated areas military zones, absentee property laws(which are selectively applied only to Palestinians who are often barred by Israel from reaching their lands), to compelled sales and others. Returning the parts of these lands which have not since been used(or which have yet to be ethnically cleansed) and do not genuinely represent an important strategic location would not jeopardise Israeli military control, civilian safety or really affect a single Israeli's life.[2](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2017/06/israel-occupation-50-years-of-dispossession/)

3) More equally distribute Palestinian water. Despite making up only 13% of the west bank population Israeli settlers use approximately 80% of the West Bank water. Palestinians are barred from building water infrastructure without explicit, and near impossible to obtain, Israeli military permission. More than a hundred Palestinian communities do not have running water as a consequence. [3](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2017/11/the-occupation-of-water/)

4)  Allow Palestinians in diaspora with western-Americans/British/French-passports equal treatment. Americans and Brits etc of Palestinian descent(if they appear on the Palestinian population registry) are barred, unlike their fellow countrymen, from flying into Ben Gurion airport, or travelling to Jerusalem without the specific(and difficult to obtain) permits. This would not only reduce discrimination, but is also the US's requirements for Israeli visa free travel. This could conceivably provide an actual benefit to Israeli's. 

5) Trial, publicly, those suspected of murder/abuse of civilians. Their are a a multitude of cases where it is very likely that soldiers/settlers have committed various crimes. From murdering of journalist[4](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2017/06/israel-occupation-50-years-of-dispossession/), to torture of children[5](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-palestinian-israel-children-idUSBRE95J0FR20130620) [6](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2017-02-22/ty-article/.premium/israel-tortures-palestinian-children-amnesty-report-says/0000017f-e731-df2c-a1ff-ff712a7f0000), to sexual assault [7](https://www.dci-palestine.org/israeli_interrogator_sexually_assaults_palestinian_child_detainee), to internationally banned weapons [8](https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20140804-military-expert-israel-is-using-3-internationally-banned-weapons-in-gaza/), to everyday verbal abuse. 92% of investigations into settler violence are closed before an indictment with only a 3% chance that a settler is indicted(not convicted) of a crime against Palestinians [23](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/files.yesh-din.org/Data+Sheet+2021+Law+Enforceme/Law+Data+21+ENG.pdf). This is the first of these which would require an active act by Israelis, and would also not necessarily materially change Palestinian lives. Without accountability and transparency though, it is impossible for Palestinians to trust Israel. This would also not affect any individual who was not found guilty by Israeli courts, and therefore would not be a security threat.

6) Denounce individuals and organisations which are advocating for, and attempting to, demolish Al-Aqsa mosque. [22](https://thirdtemple.org/en/)

7) Stop delaying and withholding Palestinian Authority taxes. Israel collects taxes on behalf of the Palestinian Authority, taking a 3% fee. However Israel has consistently stolen and delayed payments to the PA under various excuses, often as a tool to pressure Palestinians or to punish them. [9](https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-yet-to-carry-out-steps-to-boost-pa-that-it-vowed-to-implement-before-ramadan/) [10](https://www.timesofisrael.com/ministers-slap-sanctions-on-palestinian-authority-over-efforts-against-israel-at-un/) This portrays a great deal of bad faith on Israel's part. Rectifying this will allow for better finances in the PA, so that it can run its hospitals for example [26](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-60829319), and a better capacity for trust.

8) Implement building reforms to allow Palestinians in area C (60% of the WB) to build and develop their towns. It is near impossible, and intentionally so, for Palestinians to build and expand in large parts of the west bank as doing so would require Israeli permits(which are denied 99% of the time). These restrictions are only in place for Palestinians and not Israeli settlements and have strangled the economy and urban development of much of Palestine. Palestinians are unable to build schools, hospitals, new homes parks playgrounds etc etc.[11](https://www.btselem.org/topic/planning_and_building)

9) End dispossession and expulsion of communities currently being evicted and ethnically cleansed.[12](https://www.btselem.org/communities_facing_expulsion)

10) Reform Israeli military courts and administrative detentions  to ensure a neutral fair and just arbiter. This is one of the clearest apparatus of apartheid as Palestinians and Jews committing the same crime in the same place are trailed under different courts, different laws and evidentiary bases. ""The military orders are all written by Israeli soldiers and reflect what they consider to be harmful to Israeli interests. Palestinians have no way of influencing the content of the military orders that rule their lives. The military judges and prosecutors are always Israeli soldiers in uniform. The Palestinians are always viewed as either suspects or defendants, and are almost always convicted. ""  [13](https://www.btselem.org/topic/military_courts) [14](http://hrp.law.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/IHRC-Addameer-Submission-to-HRC-COI-Apartheid-in-WB.pdf)

11) Allow Palestinian Gazans to enter the West Bank and vice-versa if they enter through the ""long route"" through Egypt then Jordan without passing through Israel. This would allow Israel to comply with their agreements not to separate Gaza and the WB and treat them as one. [15](https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2013/9/12/west-bank-and-gaza-divided-20-years-later)  It's worth noting that this policy was in place prior to Hamas taking control in 2007.

12) Allow for the initial refugees to return to their homes. 700,000 Palestinians were expelled/ethnically cleansed in 1948. Allowing those initial refugees to return, at least those which have not since died, and better complying with resolution 194 will show Israel's commitment to a just and legal resolution. Furthermore this would not constitute a demographic or security threat, since these are very small numbers and consist solely of individuals in the last stages of life. It is also unlikely that many of these will even be practically able to return considering their health and the fact that none of their family will be able to follow. 

13) Allow for equal treatment for native Palestinians and Jews in occupied/annexed East Jerusalem. Treating the native Palestinians as unwanted migrants, restricting their right to remain in the city, whilst requiring allegiance and submittance to ""earn"" equal rights is clear discrimination based solely on ethnicity.[16](https://www.btselem.org/jerusalem) Similarly explicit Judaization and Palestinian population control policies (such as explicit ratio targets of non-jews:jews) must end.[17](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2022-04-06/ty-article-magazine/.highlight/maps-prove-the-judaization-of-east-jerusalem-gathers-steam/00000180-5b98-dc66-a392-7fdb31340000) [18](https://www.palestine-studies.org/en/node/1651483) [19](https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/08/08/israel-jerusalem-palestinians-stripped-status) Implementing this would not reasonably challenge the security of the region since those with Jerusalem ID's are already able to travel (relative to other Palestinians) freely. The numbers of those with Jerusalem ID's are also too small to challenge the Jewish nature of the state.

14) Un-ban Palestinian flags and symbols within Israel. This ban has ostensibly only been in place since early this year, but has been enforced extra-judicially by Israeli soldiers and police for decades. [20](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/09/israel-security-minister-bans-palestinian-flag-flying-in-public) [21](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-61672527)Reversing this would not only show a commitment to free speech and freedom of expression but would allow Palestinians in Israel to be respected and dignified.

15) End blatant collective punishment. Israel practices clear collective punishment, demolishing whole apartment blocks at times because of the action of a single suspect. This achieves nothing but increased animosity and tensions and innocent families homeless. [22](https://www.hrw.org/news/2023/02/02/israel-collective-punishment-against-palestinians) [25](https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2020/07/israels-collective-punishment-palestinians-illegal-and-affront-justice-un)

These are just some that I could think of over the course of a day or so, I am sure that their are a myriad more changes that could be made. If I think of any more I will try to add them on, or if anyone mentions some in the comments I could add it to the post if they don't mind. Changing these policies won't solve the conflict but it will go a long way to building trust, increasing Palestinian quality of life and addressing concerns. I want to point out that the majority of these would only require Israel ***to not do something***, rather than take an active action. These will also not reasonably present a danger to the Israeli state or to Israeli civilians and yet have continued to be in place despite, or more likely due to, their effects on Palestinian life. Of course you can support these policies, I am sure their will be many in the comments who will attempt to excuse these in one way or another. My point though, is that these are not necessary evils, this is not an us vs them situation. Palestinians can very much have a better, more equitable, quality of life without affecting or endangering a single Israeli.

Lastly, and because I know these are coming. The unilateral military disengagement from Gaza was not done in good faith or to try and build relations. It was simply due to demographic realities. [27](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/aug/16/comment.israelandthepalestinians) It was actually initially termed the separation plan at firs, but that was too clearly apartheid.[28](https://archive.org/details/unspeakhowwordsb00pool/page/87/mode/2up) Now it is true that 8000 settlers were removed from Gaza(who received 200,000 dollars per family), but in the same year 12000 moved into the West Bank. Gaza was then put under siege and it was clear that this was going to become a humanitarian disaster years before Hamas took power. It had the potential to be a positive move but, as human rights organisations and Palestinians warned at the time, it's intentions(ensuring a jewish majority and precluding dialogue/negotiation with Palestinians) and policies meant that it wouldn't be.  

As Ehud Olmert explains ""There is no doubt in my mind that very soon the government of Israel is going to have to address the demographic issue with the utmost seriousness and resolve. This issue above all others will dictate the solution that we must adopt. In the absence of a negotiated agreement – and I do not believe in the realistic prospect of an agreement – we need to implement a unilateral alternative... More and more Palestinians are uninterested in a negotiated, two-state solution, because they want to change the essence of the conflict from an Algerian paradigm to a South African one. From a struggle against 'occupation,' in their parlance, to a struggle for one-man-one-vote. That is, of course, a much cleaner struggle, a much more popular struggle – and ultimately a much more powerful one. For us, it would mean the end of the Jewish state... the parameters of a unilateral solution are: To maximize the number of Jews; to minimize the number of Palestinians; not to withdraw to the 1967 border and not to divide Jerusalem... Twenty-three years ago, Moshe Dayan proposed unilateral autonomy. On the same wavelength, we may have to espouse unilateral separation... \[it\] would inevitably preclude a dialogue with the Palestinians for at least 25 years.[\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_disengagement_from_Gaza#cite_note-13) ""

And, yes, Palestinians can't do much at all in return. This would most likely not directly benefit Israel or Israelis and Israel has no reason to do any of this. The same could be said for almost all positive civil social and legal reforms. They often only benefit the dis-enfranchised. I could make the argument that this would actually benefit Israelis in the long term, and I do believe it will, but that shouldn't be the measure under which we decide if something should be done. Also, again, for the majority of these all that is required is that Israel *stop doing something* which currently harms Palestinians.",ihaveneverexisted,t2_2ki2hc7m,0.68,50,241

1079,11o83op,2023-03-11,IsraelPalestine,Question for anti-Zionists: after how long do Jewish Israelis become indigenous in your opinion?,"No one disputes that prior to the aftermath of the Bar Kokhba Revolt, Judea was the homeland of the Jews and that prior to Roman occupation, they ruled themselves in that land. While some Jews continued to live in the land, the aftermath of the revolt was thr beginning of the modern diaspora of the Jewish people from their homeland.

The argument I commonly see from anti-Zionists is that just because Jews today can trace their roots back to Israel 1900 years ago doesn't mean that they can claim to be indigenous, and that Palestinian Arabs are the largest group of people who can best claim to be indigenous to the land. While many of these Palestinians cannot trace their roots back as far as the Jews, they have been living in the land longer, which gives them more of a moral claim to the land than the Jews who made aliyah and established the modern State of Israel.

I am certain that someone already has some problems with what I've written above, but for the sake of my question let's just assume that this is the argument.

My question is, at what point in time in the future can Jewish Israelis claim to be indigenous? And is there a point in which an anti-Zionist would begin to be against the right of return for the Palestinian diaspora?

Instead of doing that Hamas, from the beginning, made its goal to establish an Islamic state in the historic area of Palestine (which includes modern day Israel), and to this day prefers investing a lot of the sums that it gets in hopeless attempts at military / terrorists actions against Israel, which almost always end up in significantly more casualties on the Gaza side.  
  
The recent act against Israel will likely cause the largest casualties in Gaza so for, and I'm seriously afraid for the life of innocents civilians. Hamas is factually not able to protect Gaza in this situation.  
  
Even if you see Israel as evil and inhuman, so you are not bothered by the ethics of the latest actions against Israel that prompted the war, it's hard for me to see any of these actions as something that is supposed to get meaningful results that are good for the Palestinian people, apart from a very basic and emotional revenge, which is (very evidently) a close loop with losers on both sides.

Party because I didn't understand how horrific they attacks actually were, and partly because I believed Palestine just wanted to stop being oppressed and to live in peace.  

Then I learned about the [Hamas Charter](https://embassies.gov.il/holysee/AboutIsrael/the-middle-east/Pages/The%20Hamas-Covenant.aspx#:~:text=The%20Hamas%20charter%20is%20the,18%20years%20of%20its%20existence.) and I was horrified that the Palestinians had elected Hamas knowing their primary goal is the elimination of Israel by killing all the Jews. 

Their entire ideology is eerily similar to Adolph Hitler's Mein Kampf.  It is scary that such extremist have control of Gaza. 


 Below are passages from the Hamas Charter: 

​Goals of the HAMAS:

​""The Islamic Resistance Movement is a distinguished Palestinian movement, whose allegiance is to Allah, and whose way of life is Islam. It strives to raise the banner of Allah over every inch of Palestine."" (Article 6)


On the destruction of Israel:

""Israel will exist and will continue to exist until Islam will obliterate it, just as it obliterated others before it."" (Preamble)


The exclusive Moslem nature of the area:

""The land of Palestine is an Islamic Waqf [Holy Possession] consecrated for future Moslem generations until Judgment Day. No one can renounce it or any part, or abandon it or any part of it."" (Article 11)

""Palestine is an Islamic land... Since this is the case, the Liberation of Palestine is an individual duty for every Moslem wherever he may be."" (Article 13)


The call to jihad:

""The day the enemies usurp part of Moslem land, Jihad becomes the individual duty of every Moslem. In the face of the Jews' usurpation, it is compulsory that the banner of Jihad be raised."" (Article 15)

""Ranks will close, fighters joining other fighters, and masses everywhere in the Islamic world will come forward in response to the call of duty, loudly proclaiming: 'Hail to Jihad!'. This cry will reach the heavens and will go on being resounded until liberation is achieved, the invaders vanquished and Allah's victory comes about."" (Article 33)


Rejection of a negotiated peace settlement:

""[Peace] initiatives, and so-called peaceful solutions and international conferences are in contradiction to the principles of the Islamic Resistance Movement... Those conferences are no more than a means to appoint the infidels as arbitrators in the lands of Islam... There is no solution for the Palestinian problem except by Jihad. Initiatives, proposals and international conferences are but a waste of time, an exercise in futility."" (Article 13)


Condemnation of the Israel-Egypt Peace Treaty:

""Egypt was, to a great extent, removed from the circle of struggle [against Zionism] through the treacherous Camp David Agreement. The Zionists are trying to draw other Arab countries into similar agreements in order to bring them outside the circle of struggle. ...Leaving the circle of struggle against Zionism is high treason, and cursed be he who perpetrates such an act."" (Article 32)


Anti-Semitic incitement:

The Day of Judgment will not come about until Moslems fight Jews and kill them. Then, the Jews will hide behind rocks and trees, and the rocks and trees will cry out: 'O Moslem, there is a Jew hiding behind me, come and kill him."" (Article 7)

""The enemies have been scheming for a long time ... and have accumulated huge and influential material wealth. With their money, they took control of the world media... With their money they stirred revolutions in various parts of the globe... They stood behind the French Revolution, the Communist Revolution and most of the revolutions we hear about... With their money they formed secret organizations - such as the Freemasons, Rotary Clubs and the Lions - which are spreading around the world, in order to destroy societies and carry out Zionist interests... They stood behind World War I ... and formed the League of Nations through which they could rule the world. They were behind World War II, through which they made huge financial gains... There is no war going on anywhere without them having their finger in it."" (Article 22)

""Zionism scheming has no end, and after Palestine, they will covet expansion from the Nile to the Euphrates River. When they have finished digesting the area on which they have laid their hand, they will look forward to more expansion. Their scheme has been laid out in the 'Protocols of the Elders of Zion'."" (Article 32)

""The HAMAS regards itself the spearhead and the vanguard of the circle of struggle against World Zionism... Islamic groups all over the Arab world should also do the same, since they are best equipped for their future role in the fight against the warmongering Jews."" (Article 32)",ladyskullz,t2_e9rwszzy,0.94,46,43
1083,17or13r,2023-11-06,IsraelPalestine,Anti-Semitism/Islamophobia Jews and Muslims,"As someone raised Muslim in a western country, with middle eastern ancestry, I feel like flotsam floating on a sea of ignorance when it comes to the Israel Palestine issue. 

Online I see waves of people, Arabs, Muslims, who don’t denounce Hamas the way they should. Who don’t denounce attacks against innocent Jewish people the way they should, as if the oppressive policies of a government justify brutality against children. When it’s done in the name of Islam, it belittles all the people who profess the faith, a faith that whether you look to the Quran, or Mohammad’s example, CONDEMNS the killing of unarmed innocents. You are a stain on the faith of Islam, shame on you!! To those of you that harass Jews in person or online, shame on you.  


To my Jewish friends, people with whom genetically I share the same blood, and the same God. When a country is tied intrinsically to your faith, and even more, your ancestry and identity, you have a duty to guard it, not just physically, but spiritually and morally. Even if you are not a citizen of Israel, your blood gives you right of return, and it is the one safe homeland for all Jews. You have a duty to understand the conditions of the West Bank, and the complete lack of dignity those millions of  Palestinians face on account of their ethnicity and faith. They don’t need a full state to be given their dignity back; they need basic freedoms, and priority in their own land. When your blood lets you drive on a road just for you, and live in a house that required evicting native Arabs, you have a sacred duty to stand against it. You have a moral duty to recognize the trauma, and horror of 1948 for Arab citizens of Israel, and Palestinians. Laws meant to stifle that expression are wrong. When Hamas is defeated, it’s up to you to advocate for a just and dignified peace, in the good faith style of Matti Peled, and Rabin. 

I think we need to stop talking about “solutions”, whether that’s one state, or two. The truth is that military administration can continue in the West Bank AND the apartheid state can be dismantled. Settlers should experience a sacrifice, and return to Israel proper. Let’s not let pie in the sky solutions get in the way of human dignity. When the blight that Hamas is destroyed, sow the seeds of peace in Gaza, so that in 50 years, we can live in a world of friendship, and debunk fanatic regimes like Iran, that thrive on an Us vs Them narrative. Healing takes time, for everyone, but it must start now, and the hard work must be done. 

As Muslims, we have a duty to advocate for a practical way forward. Not simply scream “Free Palestine” and dismiss the genuine security concerns of Israeli Jews. We must denounce Hamas like it deserves.

1085,11df28o,2023-02-27,IsraelPalestine,Ali Abunimah and Electronic Intifada Declare Remembering the Holocaust is Anti-Palestinian,"Ali Abunimah, as one of the highest profile Palestinians and critics of Israel out there, recently took to [the pages of his website Electronic Intifada](https://electronicintifada.net/blogs/ali-abunimah/reclaiming-holocaust-memory-zionism) to come after, everyone say it with me: Holocaust memorials.

Yes, according to Ali, “Holocaust memory is no longer about actually remembering the victims of the European genocide, but about weaponizing their memory to justify the dispossession and persecution of the Palestinians”.

As we all know, literally everything on Earth is really about the Palestinians, and the Holocaust is no exception. Now, why does Ali think Holocaust memorials are really for justifying persecution of the Palestinians? Well, you can read the article to find out, but it’s extremely long, so I’ll give you the bullet points.

Point 1: Some EU officials believe that the Holocaust was a foundational part of the creation of the EU and that remembering it is “a cornerstone of European values.” Ali disputes whether or not this is actually true.

Point 2: The EU “officially equates”, Ali's words not mine, remembering the Holocaust with support for Israel. Ali’s evidence for this is that the Israeli President was present at an EU Holocaust memorial event and that the EU president said “The European Union and Israel are tied by a close friendship based on a shared history and common values of democracy, open society and rule of law.”

That’s it. That’s all the evidence Ali has. Did you read anything about the justification about the persecution of the Palestinians? No, you did not. All you read, and you can go read his original article if you don’t believe me, is that the EU remembers the Holocaust and the EU likes Israel. 

We see here yet another example of the kind of maximalist, black and white, you’re either with us or against mentality that is so prevalent in Palestine and among its supporters. Simply having Israelis present at a Holocaust memorial and not hating Israel as much as Ali does is equivalent to “justifying the dispossession and persecution of the Palestinians.” Because everything is all about the Palestinians. 

Naturally, though, being friends with Palestine or Palestinians doesn’t mean you support Palestinian war crimes, mass murder, and terrorism. Of course not. It just means you want Palestinians to be free. Funny how these things work. 

How sad that Jews and their friends cannot even commemorate the Holocaust without being accused of holding anti-Palestinian views. This is what true hate looks like.",ItsaMe123ABC,t2_pykt8z1f,0.81,42,31
1086,13rn9h7,2023-05-25,IsraelPalestine,Roger Waters's Latest Concert,"Roger Waters, the musician who has faced numerous criticisms for his views on Jews and Israel in the past and [was described as “the world’s most well known anti-Semite”](https://www.haaretz.com/world-news/europe/2023-02-26/ty-article/.premium/german-city-cancels-roger-waters-concert-calling-him-most-widely-known-antisemite/00000186-8e3c-d5bf-adb6-afbe9f7d0000) just [played a recent concert](https://www.jpost.com/diaspora/antisemitism/article-744072) in Berlin. Rather than stay off the topic of Jews and Israel, or keep his views about them measured and moderate, he decided to lean into the controversy and be as offensive as possible.

First, Waters himself brought up the topic of anti-Semitism.

> an announcement was displayed on a screen reading “on a matter of public interest: a court in Frankfurt has ruled that I am not an antisemite,"" sparking applause from the crowd. ""Just to be clear, I condemn antisemitism unreservedly,"" continued the announcement. 

The screen then proceeds to list people killed by various groups Waters doesn’t like:

> The screen proceeded to display the names of Sophie Scholl, an anti-Nazi activist murdered by the Nazis; Mahsa Amini, who was murdered by Iranian ""morality police""; George Floyd, who was killed by a police officer in Minneapolis; and Anne Frank, who was murdered by the Nazis in Bergen-Belsen, among other individuals killed by various authorities and regimes throughout the past century.

Anne Frank’s name was followed immediately by Shireen Abu Akleh, a Palestinian journalist killed in the crossfire between IDF forces and Palestinian militants, a killing which [the IDF took responsibility for and apologized for.](https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/11/middleeast/idf-apology-shireen-abu-akleh-intl/index.html)

Conflating Anne Frank and Shireen Abu Akleh was considered offensive by many Jewish and pro-Israel groups. First, conflating and comparing Jews/Israelis and Nazis is [considered anti-Semitic by the IHRA definition of anti-Semitism](https://www.holocaustremembrance.com/resources/working-definitions-charters/working-definition-antisemitism), a definition widely adopted by various NGOs and states. Second, there’s no comparison between a reporter killed accidentally in the crossfire of a battle and a young girl who was hunted down, sent to a concentration camp, and executed. The only question that remains is whether Waters (and his supporters, of which there are many) actually believe Abu Akleh and Anne Frank are similar, or if they’re making the comparison just to be as cruel as possible to Jews. 

Continuing on with the concert, 

> After an intermission, **Waters walked on stage in a SS uniform** as an inflatable pig with various words and symbols [*including the Star of David - TB*] and glowing eyes floated over the crowd and banners in the style of the Third Reich but with crossed hammers instead of a swastika hanging from the ceiling. Waters proceeded to fire a fake machine gun toward the audience.

I haven’t been able to find any information about the context of this act or any kind of explanation, if anyone is able to provide any, that would be greatly appreciated. I will say, though, that if people are calling you anti-Semitic to the point where you have to start your event with a disclaimer that you’re not anti-Semitic, and then you decide to go on stage in a Nazi uniform IN BERLIN, you’re not exactly doing yourself any favors. 

It seems to me like Waters truly believes he’s not an anti-Semite. He knows for a fact he isn’t. Because he, like many Palestine supporters, believes it’s up to him to decide what’s anti-Semitic and what isn’t. He doesn’t think comparing Jews to Nazis is anti-Semitic, so it isn’t. He doesn’t think saying [Israelis are proud of murdering Palestinians](https://www.memri.org/tv/pink-floyd-musician-roger-waters-sheldon-adelson-puppet-master-police-idf-murder-blacks) is anti-Semitic, so it isn’t. He doesn’t think [stating that there’s an extremely powerful Jewish lobby silencing critics of Israel](http://www.counterpunch.org/2013/12/06/an-interview-with-pink-floyds-roger-waters/) is anti-Semitic, so it isn’t. He decides what’s anti-Semitic and what isn’t, and surprise surprise, everything he says and does isn’t anti-Semitic. 

This is the world’s most well known critic of Israel and supporter of the Palestinians. It seems like he’s leaning into the provocateur role, trying to be as offensive as possible, a la Milo Yiannopoulos and the rest of the alt-right.

1089,13fh26o,2023-05-12,IsraelPalestine,Have we reached peak Palestine?,"Something about this current little war feels very different. The scale is smaller than the 2021 rocket war involving Hamas sure, but not by all that much. Meanwhile, Tel Avivim still went to an outdoor concert in the 10s of thousands. Life is seemingly still going on in Israel from what I can gather from across the pond. There hasn’t been the widespread outbreak of inter-communal Jewish/Arab violence in places like Lod and Akko.  

Even in the diaspora things feel different. Sure we are hearing about the conflict a bit, but major news outfits are almost like “seen this movie for the millionth time and the audience doesn’t care anymore.” We haven’t seen the mass-mobilization of pro-Palestinian protests. In the covid and pre-covid years, it almost seemed like the placards were pre-printed and ready to go to protest Israel even before the first rocket was fired. Now it’s been relatively quiet. Thankfully, this also means that so far we haven’t seen violence against Jews in the West (Tunisian attack of course being a horrifying example what we could see).  

Online discourse on Reddit doesn’t even seem that insane. Maybe I’m wrong but even what I’m seeing on some of the bigger news boards is almost a sense of boredom with this nonsense. Sure you have your usual suspects trying to spam presstv articles, but even those are being met with “don’t shoot unguided rockets at people”.  It doesn’t feel like this unbridled sense of vitriol at Jews and Israel that I’ve seen in the past. Even 4chan isn’t interested in this mini-conflict.  

So have we reached “peak Palestine” where the masses are truly just bored of this conflict and the fact that it is literally just the same lame movie played over and over with slight plot elements changed each time?

ive been trying to make sense of this and i think i came across it while reading ""righteous victims"" by benny morris. in it he writes, 

>*The pogroms of 1903–06 were a major precipitant of the Second Aliyah, the next wave of Jewish emigration to Palestine. The first pogrom was a turning point: Before, it seemed, Jews accepted slaughter as their fate; after Kishinev they rebelled. No longer would they accept death, beatings, rape, and pillage without resistance. Among a growing militant minority, the rage that had built up over decades, indeed centuries, exploded. Impotence would be replaced by action. Jews would no longer rely on king, baron, or policeman for protection; these had persuasively demonstrated their indifference or malevolence, and could not be trusted. Jews had to protect themselves and their own; at the very least they had to defend or assert their honor and go down fighting. \[54-55\]*  
>  
>*The new wave of immigration to Palestine, even more than the one before it, was an expression of revolt against the helplessness and humiliation of Diaspora life. Some of those who came in the Second Aliyah were veterans of the self-defense groups that had formed inside Russia in the wake of Kishinev. Self-defense was to be a major pillar of their ideology in Palestine.* ***Many of the new olim instantly translated their Russian experiences into Palestinian coinage: Arab was equated with gentile, Arab marauding with pogrom, local antagonism and territorial feuding with anti-Semitism.*** *They discerned in their new surroundings, behind every bush, under every tree, the shadow of the Russian persecutor they had left behind; collectively they were haunted by their awful past. Eventually the Arabs—and they themselves—would pay the price \[*[1](https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=xC_uIe9G2FYC&pg=GBS.PT57.w.1.0.174_223&hl=en)*\]*

the jewish people are a traumatized people. centuries of persecutions, diasporas, and pograms are embedded into their collective subconscious.

**trauma, methylation, and its effects**

even at the molecular level, trauma can stir one of the most common structural units of organic compounds—methyl groups—to latch onto dna molecules \[[2](https://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/the-role-of-methylation-in-gene-expression-1070/)\] this process, known as methylation, alters gene’s expression while repressing normal gene transcription. \[[3](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/jnc.13564)\] increased methylation may limit the gene’s ability to adapt to stressful situations \[[4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3427280/)\]. as an example, one study found that rwandan mothers and their children exposed to the tutsi genocide had unusually low levels of cortisol due to elevated levels of methylation in the glucocorticoid receptor gene and the nr3c2 gene \[[5](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261290154_The_Tutsi_genocide_and_transgenerational_transmission_of_maternal_stress_Epigenetics_and_biology_of_the_HPA_axis)\]. (cortisol is our body’s primary stress hormone; it helps the body manage fear and return to equilibrium, and the nr3c2 gene provides instructions for the production of a protein that regulates sodium levels. sodium regulation participates in blood pressure control. methylation-induced changes also affect genes related to axonal guidance, a process by which neurons map out precisely where axons go to form functional circuits). 

altered genetic pathways are associated with neurological disorders such as depression, anxiety, or post-traumatic stress disorder (ptsd).\[[6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5993080/)\] therefore, an individual who has experienced trauma—a child sold into slavery or a displaced israelite, for example—is more susceptible to developing ptsd. when the trauma victims’ genes are passed down to their children, their sons and daughters are at risk of inheriting those genes associated with ptsd as well as other mental and emotional complications \[[7](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5977074/)\]. the trauma victims not only have a greater chance of developing a mental health problem but also are less able to adapt when confronted by subsequent trauma.

# solutions

its important to know where your interlocutor is coming from. what seems to be stubborn refusal to acknowledge the humanity of palestinians may not be so much disdain for palestinians is deep empathy for those in their in group and protection over them. trauma is generalized as a protective mechanism, so everyone who shares any semblance of the original threat is a danger to their existence, and a traumatized person may perceive threats where there are none \[[8](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6095989/)\].

1. acknowledging the fact that jewish people deserve security within palestine is important, even if that wasnt the focus of the discussion. only when a perceived threat is gone can an aroused traumatized person return to baseline. its important to be practical when discussing possible solutions. not only is it impractical to draft a solution that doesnt include israels existence, it doesnt acknowledge the historical troubles jewish people have undergone nor ensure their security. platitudes like ""from the river to the sea"" arent just impractical, it heightens that sense of defensive unwillingness to compromise in pro israel individuals because they interpret those phrases as a threat to their existence. 
2. encourage exposure to and reconciliation with the perceived threat. repeated exposure to triggers desensitizes a person to the perceived threat. elevate palestinian voices. reinforce the idea that palestinians are humans like anyone else, and are not waiting for the opportunity to rise as one and slaughter every single jewish person. 

(personal thoughts: this conflict has had a horrible effect on the mental health of palestinians and i believe that recent terrorist attacks are a manifestation of the breaking of the psyche under the weight of occupation. for the sake of the wellbeing of palestinians and israelis (who, while benefitting from an unjust system, still suffer from heightened anxiety from the perceived threat), the discussion should shift to allowing palestinians to be citizens of israel with equal rights to that of israeli jews.)",sniperandgarfunkel,t2_9464gtbl,0.74,44,243
1093,13k44fc,2023-05-17,IsraelPalestine,A conversation about the rockets,"[*Note: the conversation below is a conversation about the latest Gaza conflict that, while hypothetical, is based on very real beliefs expressed by Palestine supporters who I have interacted with over the years. I hope you find it interesting and entertaining.*]

A: Did you see the news? More rocket fire on Israel. More Palestinian terrorism.

B: The real terrorists are the Israelis, who are murdering women and children on the pretext of “self-defense.” 

A: Islamic Jihad is putting their military installations in civilian structures and around civilians, like Hamas does. In order to destroy Islamic Jihad's military, civilians unfortunately do get hit in the crossfire. 

B: Exactly. And if the IDF launches a strike knowing that civilians are likely to get hit, that's murder. 

A: Even though it's Islamic Jihad's fault the civilians are present near the military targets, not the IDF?

B: Yes. Islamic Jihad has no choice but to have civilians nearby, since Gaza is one of the most densely populated places on earth. Also they're resistance fighters fighting a much stronger enemy so they can't play fair or by your Western colonial rules of war.

A: I see. And how should Israel respond to the rocket attacks, if they can't launch air strikes?

B: That’s not my problem! If they can't respond to the rockets without harming civilians, then they shouldn't respond at all! Killing women and children is always wrong. Period. The end. 

A: Except when Palestinian terrorists kill women and children?

B: I find it offensive you keep calling our resistance fighters that, we have every right to resist and if Israel doesn't like it they should end the occupation. The solution is clear and obvious but the Israelis won't do it because they care more about stealing Palestinian land than they do their own people.

A: End the occupation of what?

B: The occupation of the West Bank! What are you, stupid?

A: So if Israel ends the occupation of the West Bank, the terrorism will end?

B: Obviously! You think the Palestinians LIKE having to walk through checkpoints, having their homes raided by soldiers, and being caged in behind apartheid walls! Anyone would fight back in their situation, and really the Israelis should be grateful the Palestinians are as peaceful as they are. Israel needs to end the occupation TODAY. Pack up their shit and go.

A: But Israel ended the occupation of Gaza and the situation got worse…as we all saw this week.

B: Well of course they did! You can't just leave unilaterally, it creates a power vacuum. You have to do so as part of a negotiated peace treaty.

A: OK, and do Islamic Jihad and other Palestinian groups want to sign a peace treaty with Israel?

B: With the evil apartheid Zionists? Absolutely not! From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free!

A: So Israel has to withdraw from the West Bank to stop the rocket attacks, but withdrawing without a peace treaty will cause more rocket attacks, and no one wants to sign a peace treaty with Israel. So there's nothing Israel can do to stop the rocket attacks other than military air strikes, and when it uses the air strikes you call it a murderer of women and children.

1094,11su8kp,2023-03-16,IsraelPalestine,Latest PCPSR Findings: Widespread Palestinians Support for Murder and Rogue Armed GRoups,"The latest [Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research poll](https://www.pcpsr.org/en/node/935) is out, and this group is an invaluable resource for learning how actual Palestinians think and what they believe, which is often quite at odds to what their online defenders say they think and believe. Here are some highlights:

> 68% of the public (71% in the Gaza Strip and 66% in the West Bank) say they are in favor of forming armed groups such as the “Lions’ Den,” which do not take orders from the PA and are not part of the PA security services; 25% are against that.

> The vast majority (87%) says the PA does not have the right to arrest member of these armed groups in order to prevent them from carrying out attacks against Israel or to provide them with protection; only 8% say they favor it.

> If the PA attempted to disarm the newly created armed groups, a majority of 59% thinks that members of these groups will use their arms to resist the PA security services; 8% think they will surrender; and 23% think they will resist the PA but non-violently.

A clear majority of Palestinians are in favor of illegal, rogue armed groups that answer to no one and certainly not the Palestinian government going out and killing Israelis. And in fact, the VAST majority of Palestinians think the PA not only shouldn't arrest members of these groups, but isn't even allowed to do it. Plus, a majority support the armed groups actively fighting the PA with lethal violence. Some might say that resistance is fine and the PA should let Palestinians kill whoever they want. Fascinating stuff. Let's see what else we found out

> **A large majority of 71% say they support the shooting of two settlers in Huwara** while 21% express opposition to this and similar armed attacks.

Almost three quarters of Palestinians, a ""large majority"", actively support the gunning down of two unarmed Israelis. What words can anyone say about this kind of widespread support for murder? Some might say that it's not murder if it's settlers, I suppose. 

Last but not least, Palestinian views on the two-state and one-state solutions:

> Support for the concept of the two-state solution stands at 27% and opposition stands at 71%. 

> Reflecting on the latest UN speech of president Abbas in which he described the situation on the ground in the West Bank as “apartheid” and that the Palestinian people will demand equal rights in one state for two peoples, 22% say that they are in favor of such one state solution while 75% expressed opposition.

Both ""solutions"" are extremely unpopular with the Palestinian people. What solution would they prefer? The poll doesn't say. Maybe the Jordan solution? Maybe from the river to the sea Palestine will be an Arab Muslim state with unequal rights for Arabs over Jews? Not sure. 

In conclusion, thank you to the PCPSR for your invaluable research and findings. Only once we know the actual facts on the ground about people's views can we address the problems head on and make progress towards a solution.",foxer_doesnt_mod,t2_71m00thyp,0.88,43,151
1095,17k0w8g,2023-10-30,IsraelPalestine,Free Palestine: The reality.,"Palestinians need to find a collective voice that reaches out to the UN, the world, and yes, even Israel and say ""**We want to be rid of Hamas, Iranian influence, and radical Islam. Please help us achieve this and we will work with all parties to form a functional government and state**"".

 This is the only path forward. Fighting Israel hasn't working over the last 70 years. Does anyone really think relying in war and terrorism would ever work? Hashtags and TikToks? More hate crimes against Jews around the world? This will only make Israelis dig in deeper.  

If Palestinians can show they can actually function as a state and rid themselves of terrorism, this will force Israel to pull back, end settlement expansion, and finalize a 2SS. Until that happens, Israel will have all the reasons it needs to maintain a military occupation.

1096,17842nj,2023-10-15,IsraelPalestine,"Gaza war moderation update Oct 14, 2023","First off this is a metapost. Discussion about the sub is invited in comments beneath this post as you can see from the flair. 

r/IsraelPalestine has policies of disclosure and transparency.  I want to provide an update on moderation to the sub's userbase.  The Oct 7th attack by Hamas was massively damaging to Israel.  Israelis are experiencing real cultural trauma from it.  Very analogous to what Americans went through on Sept 11, 2001.   Quite a lot of the moderators on this sub are Israeli, and they are going through this trauma.  Some moderators have lost family.  Far more of our user base is acting up than normal violating sitewide rules because they are stressed.  At the same time this sub is seeing the largest surge in new users it has ever experienced both in terms of absolute numbers and in terms of daily basis percentage increases.  Over the years I've had to do these reports generally when there is violence in the West Bank or Gaza.  Generally our sub has held up very well to reasonably well.  This time the status report is going to be more of a mixed bag.  Because the attack on Israel is coming so close temporally with the regime change operation in Gaza we are getting and will continue to get a lots of occasional users objecting to the Israeli on Gazan violence to come over the next weeks. Which means the mod team is not going to get a chance to find our balance. 

Over the last week we had days of 1000 reports / day.  Low days were around 300.   This is simply more than the mod team can handle by about 6-fold.  We are not under pressure, we simply flooded. To handle this volume we implemented 4 automatic removal scripts.  As our rules clearly state moderators don't make use of remove very much, rather we add a disciplinary warning comment by hand (and sometimes the automod does so) sometimes tracking it against the user.  Removes are reserved for flames, sitewide violations, spam, or particularly problematic comments.  That has not been happening.  We've had a ton of removes based on scripts.  Those scripts have had a lot of false positives.  I'd estimate we might have removed as many as 1000 rules compliant comments in using these scripts. That is totally unacceptable both to you and to us.  We have turned to the script aggressiveness down and will continue to experiment to see if any of these scripts are viable.  

One we may continue to use for a few more weeks is the low sub karma script which is more aggressive against users who are heavily downvoted and less aggressive against users who are heavily upvoted. This script appears to be having the most positive impact on reducing reports.  Our policy for years has been that voting is an annoying feature of Reddit that we wish we could disable but can't.  We have experimented a few times with various ways to diminish it with mixed success, none of those means are being employed now.   As we have acknowledged many times for years, we have more pro-Israeli than pro-Palestinian users which means the voting on this sub is quite biased.  Combining a rule enforcement system with a detection system known to be unfair and biased means unequal enforcement. That is to say a greater percentage of comments from pro-Palestinian posters will be incorrectly removed under this system.  This is completely unfair, antithetical to the whole ethos of a debate sub and something we urgently need to address.  As a sub we are trying to stay compliant with Reddit's sitewide rules about moderators handling their duties. This is especially important on issues of ethnic conflict which Reddit is very worried about, and of course this is top story in many global newspapers which further raises the scrutiny.  While the mods don't have a great solution as of today we at least want to be transparent this is happening, which is the least this sub's mods can do.   If you are a pro-Palestinian poster with an important well written comment you see removed incorrectly please flag a mod directly.  We can add you as an approved user if you have a history of good comments which I believe we can detect in the script. At the very least we can restore the comment and hopefully adjust the AI by notifying the AI of this and other removes. 

The second major announcement is a temporary rules change. We are going to call this ""rule 20: the IDF safety announcement rule"".  It will not be on the sidebar due to Reddit limitations.   The IDF is going to be sending safety information to Gazan civilians.   Hamas is deliberately sending out misinformation to Gazan civilians regarding safety information to help them maintain human shields.   We have lots of leftist ""speak truth to power"" types who tend to dislike authority picking these memes up. In this conflict we have many quasi-newsish sites putting out a lot of fake reports to get click revenue.    The IDF is doing a poor job of keeping their military operations fully consist with their advice to Gazan civilians.  Quite rightfully, but quite harmfully, this inconsistency is undermining IDF's credibility on these safety warnings. Generally as a sub we come down hard on the side of debate and against demanding adherence to a particular viewpoint.  We think free speech is vital, and free debate is vital.  However, at the end of the day on this issue we think it is more important to make sure that any Gazans reading this sub get accurate safety information than that we allow free speech and free debate about what the safety information is.  This is a debate that could quite literally get people killed.   So effective immediately under rule 20 debating IDF instructions or comments that are misleading about IDF instructions will be removed, and any mod can ban on this offense without further warning.  You still do have appeal rights under rule 13 for rule 20 violations.  This is another rule we intend to rescind as quickly as possible, because it is yet again us putting our thumb on the scale between the IDF and Hamas. 

Finally, since the root cause of both of the above is the fact that we are flooded I'm going to break with another policy.  We generally do not like to promote mods during news related surges.  We promote during quiet times to make sure people have a chance to ask questions and get coaching when we have excess moderators.  We have promoted some temporary mods who have experience on other large volume subs but lack the knowledge of details of the conflict we would normally demand of a mod.  But I'm asking users, particularly non-Israeli users, who have been regulars even if they haven't been and would like to mod to let us know you are willing. If you get selected you'll get brought on with less support and warm up time than normal but at this point something is better than nothing. I'd also ask any less active mods to help out with report queue if you can. 

Obviously a lot of this is controversial we genuinely welcome comments and questions. And of course as this is a metapost as usual this is the right place to discuss anything else about the sub you would like to discuss.",JeffB1517,t2_hzxewvo,0.95,44,115

1098,14jhhpx,2023-06-26,IsraelPalestine,"Hamtramck, Michigan, and the One State Solution","Last week, the latest controversy in the US centered around a Detroit suburb named Hamtramck, because the town council there decided to ban LGBT+ flags from being flown on city property. [From the AP](https://apnews.com/article/hamtramck-michigan-no-pride-flags-c380f8cdad592d69af9b2080ab4cc9cd):

>  A Detroit-area community has banned LGBTQ+ flags from publicly owned flagpoles after a tense hours long meeting that raised questions about discrimination, religion and the city’s reputation for welcoming newcomers.

Why did the town council ban the flags? 

> Some members of the all-Muslim council said the pride flag clashes with the beliefs of some members of their faith. Businesses and residents aren’t prohibited from displaying a pride flag on their own property.
> “We want to respect the religious rights of our citizens,” Choudhury said.
> The council voted unanimously to display only five flags, including the American flag, the Michigan flag and **one that represents the native countries of immigrant residents.** 

Back in December 2021, [Hamtramck made the news](https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/18/us/michigan-hamtramck-all-muslim-council/index.html) for having the first all-Muslim city council in the entire United States. The liberals of the town cheered the diversity and progressivism exemplified by their new council. As for the council itself, the new mayor assured residents, “We are proud of our beliefs and values. But we are not going to try and impose them on others.” Two short years later, apparently that’s no longer the case. 

So what does this have to do with Israel and Palestine? 

A significant portion of pro-Palestine individuals are advocates for the so-called “1 state solution” or “1SS” for short. They count among their ranks such high profile individuals as Peter Beinart, Ali Abunimah, and Mehdi Hassan. 

The foundation, the entire narrative, for the 1SS is that if Israel and Palestine erase the borders and become one single state for both nations, everything will be great, everyone will be happy, everyone’s rights will be respected, and peace will reign forever and ever.

Now, there’s absolutely no evidence ever presented that this is what would happen. There are no historical precedents about something like this happening and succeeding. There are [at least two](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_Yugoslavia) precedents of [something like this happening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissolution_of_Czechoslovakia) and ending in catastrophic failure, but that never seems to bother 1SSers. Advocacy for a 1SS is far more a matter of faith than of reason. And now here comes yet another rational argument against the 1SS.

Western leftists have a misguided belief that all the groups in their intersectionality continuum think and believe the same things they believe. They were completely shocked and stunned to see that this all-Muslim council in Hamtramck is conservative and actively anti-gay. They shouldn’t have been, [polling tells us](https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/religious-landscape-study/religious-tradition/muslim/views-about-homosexuality/) that views of US Muslims are about 50-50 pro vs. anti-gay, and when it’s Muslim immigrants it rises to 77% anti-gay. Western leftists assume that because Muslims are a minority in the US and immigrants and “brown”, they are leftists just like them. They’re not. 

Likewise, 1SSers assure us that if Palestinians become the majority in Israel, they will run the country like 1SSers would. Continue to respect things like Jewish rights, women’s rights, gay rights, trans rights. Why should we expect them to do that? Because 1SSers say so. And, yes, we have polls for 1SSers to ignore too. [The last one about Palestinian views on homosexuality](https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2013/06/04/global-acceptance-of-homosexuality/) I found was from 2013, so ten years ago, but it said that only 4%, FOUR PERCENT, of Palestinians think homosexuality should be acceptable in society. You can also look at the state of Palestine today, which is an Arab Muslim state ruled by shar’ia law. In Gaza, same-sex activity between men is illegal, and nowhere in Palestine are there any civil rights laws to protect LGBT people from discrimination. [Read more here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_in_the_State_of_Palestine)

Hamtramck gives us a clear illustration that today, in 2023, some conservative Muslims have no issue putting their religious views into law over the wants of other marginalized groups, and those are US Muslims who live in a free country that embraces gay people (for the most part) and has a robust democratic process.

1100,10z59kj,2023-02-10,IsraelPalestine,"Israel, since It's inception, has never offered palestinians a 2 state solution.","Israel has never offered Palestinians a sovereign,  viable, and independent state since its inception in 1948, and its leaders use the ""2ss"" entirely disingenuously.

Anyone hearing the ""2 state solution"", or of the ""2 states for 2 peoples"" rhetoric is often misled into believing that this entails 2 separate and independent states which each have a reasonable chance for viability. Unfortunately, this has never been the case for the Palestinians. Every single deal given to Palestinians has limited the sovereignty of the state to such an extent that it can not be genuinely regarded as independent. Furthermore, it has rendered the state practically ungovernable as a single entity.

Every single offer given to Palestinians has proposed a palestinian ""state"" without the ability to protect itself whatsoever, no sovereignty over all resources, no sovereignty over the airspace, borders or the ability to decide its own international alliances without Israels permission. If your country could not protect itself, didn't have sovereignty over its waters and airspace, couldn't decide for itself, its international alliance, I highly doubt you would argue you had independence.

Secondly, the state would be utterly unviable as a singulare entity. The deals have varied, but palestine has been either cut up into 2 or 3 separate cantons between which all movement is either completely banned or greatly restricted by a foreign entity. Imagine for a minute If their was no movement between your capital city and large parts of your population. Practically speaking, it would be impossible for this stage to reliably act as one entity since movement is restricted so much between areas. Collection of taxes, running basic services, policing, security and infrastructure would have to be entirely disconnected and as a state that is at the very least very difficult nevermind the prior sovereignty issues and instability of the region. 

So if by 2ss you mean 2 separate independent viable states, then Israel has never offered this to Palestinians. If that isn't what you mean by 2ss, then you are using the term disengeniously imo, since it connotes equality between said 2 states and the independence and viability of the states. I am not trying to debate whether or not this is just. It can be just, even necessary,  in your opinion.  But it is not an independent viable palestinian state.

1103,166amfp,2023-08-31,IsraelPalestine,On the claim that Palestinians are the descendants of the original inhabitants,"One thing I've learned from speaking to anti-Israel people is that one should fact check literally everything they say and take nothing on faith. Today, I'm going to give a really good example.

A talking point I've been hearing for a long time is that the Palestinians are the descendants of the inhabitants of Palestine that have been there for centuries, well before the Arab conquests, and that the Arab conquests didn't displace pretty much anyone and the Arabs just took over as the ruling class. [Here's a quotation from DeColonizePalestine.com](https://decolonizepalestine.com/myth/palestinians-are-arabs-that-arrived-in-the-7th-century/) that sums up this talking point. 

>  The Palestinian Arabs of today did not suddenly appear from the Arabian Peninsula in the 7th century to settle in Palestine, but are the same indigenous peoples living there who changed how they identified over time.

And [here's another](https://reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/15kkzx5/propalestinianism_contextfree_from_the_river_to/jv723zo/) from a certain r/IsraelPalestine user that inspired me to write this text post. 

>  the Palestinian Arabs are largely the descendants of the people who lived in Palestine prior to the 7th century Arab conquest.... Neither the Arabs nor the Byzantines expelled or committed genocide against the peoples they conquered in Palestine.

Hopefully these two quotations show that this talking point is deployed by anti-Israeli folks and is not a ""strawman.""

Anyway, this claim is false on a number of levels. The level I would like to discuss today is the claims that the Arabs didn't displace anyone and the Palestinians are the same population living there continuously since before the Arab conquest.

[According to the Wikipedia page on the origin of the Palestinians,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_of_the_Palestinians) which I believe more than random Redditors and propaganda pages,

> The Arabs, having adopted the religion of Islam, conquered the Levant in the 7th century, and in the following centuries, several Arabic-speaking Muslim dynasties such as the Umayyads, Abbasids, and Fatimids came to rule the region. **Palestine's population sharply declined throughout the subsequent centuries, falling from an estimated 1 million during the Roman and Byzantine periods to roughly 300,000 by the early Ottoman period**.

I can't speculate as to the reason why the population of Palestine dropped so dramatically, with 2/3rds of the population leaving the area, but it certainly didn't happen by accident. [And then, at the same time,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_Muslim_conquests)

> The military victories of armies from the Arabian Peninsula heralded the expansion of Arab culture and religion. **The conquests were followed by a large-scale migration of families and whole tribes from Arabia into the lands of the Middle East.**

So what do we know? We know that the population of Palestine in general sharply, dramatically, decreased after the Arab conquest. We also know that there was a large-scale migration of Arabs into Palestine. It makes a heck of a lot more sense that the Palestinians today, who identify as Arabs, speak Arabic and have Arabic cultural traits, are descended from those Arabs rather than some amorphous 300,000 survivors of their conquests, many of which were Jews. Either way, there's no basis in fact to claim that the population in Palestine today is the same population that was there pre-Arab conquest. We can't possibly know for a fact that those 300,000 people living there at the Ottoman period were all or even mostly descendants of people living there pre-Arab conquests, and it seems remarkably unlikely that they are. 

Based on these facts, there seems to be no basis for this claim (which of course is never backed up by facts of their own) that ""the Palestinian Arabs are largely the descendants of the people who lived in Palestine"" and certainly not the descendants of ""the indigenous peoples"". Genetic studies, which are often pointed to by Palestinian advocates, do show Palestinians share genetic markers with inhabitants of the Levant who aren't Arabs, but the same is also true for Jews, even Jews living in Europe for centuries, and the Palestinians also share genetic markers with Arabs from places like Yemen, Saudi Arabia and far off Morocco.

And that's OK! They're allowed to be what they are, the descendants of people who lived in Palestine over the centuries, including migrating Arabs. Their supporters are just not allowed to lie about it and say they're something that they're not for political clout.",TracingBullets,t2_w8btvkv3,0.75,41,271
1104,17d3658,2023-10-21,IsraelPalestine,Why i a Saudi and alot of Saudis and Gulf neighbors Stand with Israel ? 🇮🇱🇸🇦,"Since my last post, alot of angry Palestinians and non-Gulf Arabs were mad, I translated this Article (from a Palestinian writer) that shows the History and everything between Palestinians and Gulf people.  

“ The Necessary Gulf-Palestinian Confrontation!


It is no secret to any observer that there are voices in the Gulf who feel anger and resentment towards some Palestinian factions, currents, and activists, and that this anger is reflected in their views and visions of the issue.

I do not agree with the lazy interpretations that portray every Gulf citizen who does not show sympathy for the cause and/or criticizes some of the leaders and factions of the Palestinian struggle as a Zionist and/or a fake account.


Perhaps some people will comment with the usual saying ""this is not the time,"" and I say that I believe that this time is precisely the most important time to discuss this issue. 

Also, the slogan ""this is not the time"" actually means ignoring the issue and not discussing it because the time will always be ""inconvenient."" I believe that it is no longer acceptable to deal with our problems with the principle of ""sweeping the dust under the rug"" to hide them.

The Gulf citizen sees that he has not found Palestinian loyalty in return for his issues, in contrast to the loyalty of the Gulf, peoples and rulers, to his cause.

 The proponents of this view (who are not few) cite the examples of Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait, the support of the Fatah movement for him, and the demonstrations that took place in the camps, the occupied Palestinian territories, and Jordan, chanting the name of Saddam and calling for him to go to Saudi Arabia. 

This happened again in the face of the Houthis in Yemen, in addition to the bias of some factions towards Iran and the adoption of a vision of its axis at the expense of the interests of the Gulf Arab countries. In addition, insults and belittling of the Gulf have been issued in the writings of some Palestinian activists.
The Palestinian must ask himself why?

First, no Gulf state has ever conspired against Palestine, its people, or its leadership, and/or intervened to support one faction at the expense of another. This happened from the Syrian and Iraqi regimes, and some other regimes.

Second, of all the countries surrounding Palestine: (Lebanon, Jordan, Syria, Egypt) only Egypt is the only country where the Palestinian has not been slaughtered or persecuted, and has not been involved in any Palestinian blood or incitement to it, while the Palestinian has been slaughtered in the three countries, as well as in Iraq. The Gulf has not been involved in any Palestinian blood or supported any party that has shed Palestinian blood.

Third, every bullet, every bit of experience, and every Palestinian military operation since the launch of the Palestinian Revolution launched by the Fatah movement on January 1, 1965, has the Gulf in it, governments and peoples, contributing a dirham or dinar or riyal, and they are genuine partners in the resistance.

Fourth, the first to raise the banner of the Palestinian Revolution, and the need for the Palestinian to defend his land without waiting for the armies and Arab regimes, was the Fatah movement, which was founded in the Gulf in Kuwait with the money of Gulf donations and Palestinians working in the Gulf.

Fifth, the Gulf provided every Palestinian with the opportunity to work and live with dignity, and it was a relationship of mutual benefit between the two sides, and the Palestinian had a higher hand in it, as he was the owner of a cause that concerns every Gulf government and citizen.

Sixth, in all the situations in which the Palestinian resistance fighter was subjected to restrictions or attempts to be eliminated, Egypt and the Gulf, alone and without any exaggeration, were the ones who intervened with all their strength to save him. This happened when the Assad regime tried to get rid of them and/or turn them into puppets in his hands, as well as in Black September 1971 and the siege of Beirut in 1982.

Seventh, since 1965 until 1991, more than 80% of the money that the resistance fighter received to fight and struggle, and the authority after Oslo, and the refugees in the camps, came from the Gulf.

Eighth, in all international forums, the Gulf states have not abandoned a unified and strict position towards the Palestinian right.

Ninth, I do not believe that there is a single Gulf citizen over the age of forty who has not donated a portion of his money to the Palestinian cause.

Tenth, the Gulf has never asked the Palestinian to fight for him, with him, or for his benefit in any of his battles or external conflicts. 

The old Gulf, or rather the distorted image of the Gulf that still haunts the minds of some 
Arabs, needs to be corrected and updated.

I understand that some people may have political observations on some Gulf policies that directly affect them, but gloating, insults, and name-calling only harm the unity around the issue.

All revolutionary republics have failed and collapsed, leaving only the ruins of states.

The Palestinian who criticizes the Gulf because he wants his governments to adopt the same rhetoric does not realize that the Gulf has its own policies based on calmness and dealing with difficult situations with foresight. For example, there are three islands occupied by Iran. 


The new Gulf citizen is no longer affected by nationalist propaganda, which does not mean that he has abandoned his Arabism, or Islamic propaganda, which does not mean that he has abandoned his Islam. 

But he elevates the status of his national identity, after a period of wandering in subsidiary allegiances such as tribe, region, sect, or internationalism such as political Islam. 

For him, the interests of his state come first, the Gulf region by virtue of geography, political, economic, and cultural homogeneity, second, the Arab world third, and the Islamic world.


According to this perspective, when he finds a lack of sympathy, support, or support for sensitive security issues for his country and/or its contempt or insult, and in return, celebrating its enemies or those who want it harm, under the pretext that I am a Palestinian and Palestine is my first issue and I will stand even with the devil if he would help me liberate it, it is natural for his reaction to be; So, my country comes first, Israel is not on my borders, it has not fought me or gloated at me, and there are common enemies between me and them, and since you deny me my right in the issues of my country, I will not stand with you, and perhaps I will go to establish a relationship or alliance with Israel to protect my country that is happy to be hit by my opponents.”",Status_Slide1755,t2_3g2cm4i2,0.8,40,81
1105,13ql2mu,2023-05-24,IsraelPalestine,The Other Palestine Narrative,"Something I’ve noticed about pro-Palestinian activism is that it truly seems to be bipolar. It oscillates between two diametrically opposed worldviews. 

On the one hand, they seem to believe Palestine is the biggest, most oppressed, most pathetic, most downtrodden, victim in the world. Palestinians are literally suffering genocide, apartheid, war crimes, crimes against humanity. Ethnic cleansing is happening every day. They need your help TODAY because Israel is about to wipe them all out TODAY. Not only is Israel like Nazi Germany, it's actually WORSE than Nazi Germany. Not only is Israel like apartheid South Africa, it's actually WORSE than apartheid South Africa. Somehow.

But did you guys know that there's another pro-Palestinian narrative, that is more common outside of Reddit? This narrative goes that Palestine is a badass fighter on the verge of victory. Its people are all heroes, its fighters are superheroes, and if you bully your local Jews just a little bit more, Israel is going to collapse and Palestine will be restored from the river to the sea. Palestine is strong, Palestine has the world at its back, Palestine is beloved, and Israel sucks, is a pariah state, and is on the run.

Don’t believe me? Let me show you some examples. I feel like I don’t really need to show examples of the first mentality, the victim mentality, since that seems to be the prevailing viewpoint among Palestine advocates on Reddit. Feel free to ask, though, and I can show some.

Here’s some examples of the second mentality, the we’re awesome mentality, in action.

[Here’s a tweet from a Palestinian woman](https://twitter.com/AlgerianPalest/status/934120972621369345): “I was born Palestinian, I was taught at a very young age never to look down or to turn them away ... I am of the race of the winners.”

[Here’s an amazing tweet](https://twitter.com/iamhussainahmed/status/271373868130770945) that reads: “they used to say Palestinians fight like heroes, now they say heroes fight like Palestinians” LOL.

But some better examples are the cartoons of Carlos Latuff, an extremely popular pro-Palestinian cartoonist. He’s got dozens of cartoons depicting Palestinians as victims, of course, often with Israelis depicted as Nazis. 

But peculiarly, he also has some very popular cartoons depict Palestine or Palestinians as winners, victors, on top of the heap.

[Here’s a cartoon of Palestine spanking US President at the time Donald Trump](https://mondoweiss.net/2017/12/thousand-carlos-latuff/) and putting him in his place. According to Mondoweiss, the cartoon was so popular it was deployed at demonstrations. 

[Here’s another one of “Mama” Palestine kicking Israeli soldiers out of her way](https://twitter.com/LatuffCartoons/status/1163118133269454848)

[And here’s a third one of a scared Israeli soldier on the run from big tough Palestinians coming to kick his butt](https://latuffcartoons.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/mother-palestine-sheikh-jarrah-al-aqsa-mother-palestine-mondoweis-latuff.jpg)

Latuff exemplifies this bipolarity in the place of Palestinians. No wonder their society is so screwed up! They can’t even maintain a consistent narrative in their own minds!

I should also point out that this kind of mentality is very common among other totalitarian regimes: that their enemy is both incredibly strong and incredibly weak. That's why we hear pro-Palestinians wailing that the Israel Lobby prevents them from doing anything to help the poor victims of Palestine, but also that if a bunch of college freshmen get a BDS resolution passed at their local community college the Zionist entity will collapse altogether. Yes it doesn't make any sense but as we have discussed in the past, the pro-Palestine movement is full of contradictions.

So I would like to hear what you all think about this dichotomy of narratives. Does anyone think this self-contradicting narrative makes anyone take Palestine seriously? Do you think such a narrative serves the interests of peace? Because I do not.",TracingBullets,t2_w8btvkv3,0.75,41,59
1106,10tzumq,2023-02-05,IsraelPalestine,What’s the game plan for Palestinians?,"Something I immensely fail to understand of Palestinian advocates regarding the conflict is their optics in bringing a better livelihood for their people. The current reality is that Israel is encroaching on the West Bank through its settlements and human rights violations. Gaza is pretty much an open-air prison where Israel centrally plans their entire resource allocation. Fatah is an unreliable and corrupt moderate party with waning power in the West Bank which will likely disappear after Abbas dies. Hamas is a corrupt Islamist group that doesn’t give a damn about their people and regularly advocates for genocide of Jews. In the meanwhile, Israel is approaching a dictatorship of far-right religious expansionists, elected by a distraught population fueled by ethno-nationalism and inaction by leadership on both sides.

With that being said, it eludes me as to why Palestinians are so insistent on some kind of violent conflict that will somehow result in them winning. This “free Palestine from the river to sea” or “Long Live the Intifada” slogans are appealing to absolutely no one with power on the issue. The blatant anti-Israeli, nation and people of the nationality, rhetoric and action is just motivating more Israelis to give support to Netanyahu. Even if they successfully have a massive violent conflict(3rd Intifada), they will all be crushed and many will likely be deported when Israel inevitably annexes the West Bank. 

So, I’m hoping mainly Palestinians can elucidate on what’s exactly the plan? Because to me, it seems like an act of pure desperation with tactics motivated by state-actors like Iran and Hamas that have no interest in ending the conflict.",ninnovation,t2_23agyzr6,0.81,39,100

[ Protests near the headquarters of the Palestinian government to demand an improvement in the conditions of teachers \(Anatolia\) ](https://preview.redd.it/xlaj4vfropoa1.png?width=770&format=png&auto=webp&s=b5104241671bb8b856de3e4f95dc619f69109aa6)

West Bank teachers have been on strike since 2/Feb/2023 due to the government not fulfilling it's promise. The teachers want to receive their full pay (WB Government gives all employees around %85 pay with prisoners & others receiving full pay), their %15 bonus and a democratically elected Teacher's union (which is currently appointed by the government)

*Note:* A previous strike started on Apr/2022, lasted for 50 days after which the government promised to fulfil the teachers demands but never did.

According to the Palestinian government statistics from 2022 

* there are 1,358,000 students
* Most are from the West Bank
* \~1,000,000 are in public schools
* 74,000 teachers
   * 52,000 Teachers are in government schools
* Total government employees 240,000
* Wage cost $300,000 (2021 statistics)

[ Hundreds of teachers are protesting in front of the Council of Ministers in Ramallah to demand the implementation of a previous agreement with the government that includes an allowance ](https://preview.redd.it/wjshrahuopoa1.png?width=770&format=png&auto=webp&s=40c0e5d09f024996ab340553df75ef2b87b4a671)

The strike is run by the ""teachers' movement"" under an unannounced leadership for fear of penalties and security prosecutions. The Teacher's union is against the strike but the teacher's union is elected by the Palestinian government & the teachers demand it to be democratically elected.

The government through the security services put up barriers to thwart the teachers' sit-in.

The government ignored the strike for two weeks while the Ministry of Education sent letters to teachers stating that strike days would be deducted from their salaries.

When the strike reached the 2nd month the unions of lawyers, engineers, doctors, nurses, and journalists announced in separate statements that they join the demand protests and strike on specific days.

*Response from Deputy Education Minister Oliyan Ayyoub* 

>The academic year will be extended in order to compensate students for the lessons they have missed.  
>  
>The government would pay the teachers' full salaries once they have access to sufficient funds to do so.

The government reasoning for the financial crisis are that at the beginning of 2023, Israel decided - as part of sanctions against the Palestinian Authority - to deduct about $40 million from ""clearance"" funds for the benefit of those affected by Palestinian operations (""Palestinian operations"" meaning terrorist attacks against civilians), in addition to previous deductions estimated at one billion dollars annually (Israel anti pay-for-slay. Palestinian government spending on pay-for-slay is about $865 million annually which they've announced they will pay even if it's the last shekel they have).

Wasel Abu Youssef, a member of the Executive Committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization, believes that 

>""what is happening in terms of crises, specifically on the economic and living levels, is part of an open war against the Palestinian people, the occupation seeks to put pressure on the Palestinian situation, and this creates more crises.""

&#x200B;

Abu Youssef, who mediates between the government and the unions in his capacity as head of the Popular Organizations Department in the PLO, believes that it is in the interest of the occupation to destabilize the situation in the occupied territories. 

>""It is no secret that the occupation is trying to weaken and undermine the authority and perpetuate the occupation and its survival. Without the effective intervention of the international community, the imposition of international protection, and the obligation of the occupation to stop all aggression policy, including money piracy, the situation continues to worsen.""

&#x200B;

The director of the Yabous Center for Consultations and Strategic Studies, Suleiman Bisharat, agrees with Abu Youssef

>""Any occupation in the world is based on the principle of creating crises so that it can implement its plans and control the occupied peoples, the Palestinians have been living since the Nakba 1948,   
 successive and successive crises; the first and main beneficiary of them is the occupation.""  
>  
>any economic, developmental or political stability means, for the occupation, the formation of a state that represents the administration of a state or state institutions and thus achieving development, which strengthens the spirit of resistance and rejection of pressure, and this is not wanted by the Israeli occupation.

&#x200B;

As for a member of the Political Bureau of the Palestinian People’s Party, Fahmy Shaheen, believes that the strike crisis is caused by “mismanagement,” 

>“the demands of the teachers were previously agreed upon, and the government did not adhere to them, the government could have opened a serious and responsible dialogue and reached solutions with all parties.""

&#x200B;

For about two years the Palestinian government has been [punishing its law-abiding employees ](https://palwatch.org/page/30607)by paying them only partial salaries and then blaming Israel for it (due to Israel anti pay-for-slay policy in which it deduces pay-for-slay money from the Palestinian government income).

But an examination of the financial reports published by the PA Ministry of Finance shows that from the years 2018 (the year Israel passed its Anti Pay-for-Slay law) to 2022, the overall income of the PA **grew by 3.5 billion shekels.** The vast majority of that growth - **2.5 billion shekels** \- actually came from the taxes Israel collects and doesn’t withhold.

> Over the course of three weeks, a German man who stoked antisemitism while claiming to be Jewish was unmasked and faced a public downfall.

> Frank Borner, a school teacher, had hosted two gatherings called “Meet a Jew” on the island of Fehmarn, on the northern coast of Germany. 

> On Tuesday, the news website Fehmarn 24 reported that the organization that was hosting these talks pulled the plug on future events with Borner. When asked by Fehmarn 24 if he is a Jew, Borner refused to answer.

> German Jewish author Henryk M. Broder and his colleague Moritz Gerlach first broke the story about Borner’s manufactured Jewish identity in the daily broadsheet Die Welt on July 19. The Welt journalists wrote that Borner claimed that Jews have a  “capacity for suffering.” Borner linked the alleged Jewish suffering to a “victim role” that adheres to Jews “archetypically, like primordial slime.”

> Borner also claimed in his talk that New York and Hollywood are “full of Jews” and “firmly in Jewish hands.”

It seems that in this brave new world where most civilized societies are anti-racist and anti-bigotry, the best way to spread anti-Semitism is to pretend to be a Jew and engage in ""introspection"" and ""self-criticism."" 

Borner's rhetoric about how New York and Hollywood are ""in Jewish hands"" is strikingly similar to ""anti-Zionist rhetoric"" about how Washington is controlled by Zionists. This is not a coincidence.

1109,11x6e0r,2023-03-21,IsraelPalestine,Equating all jews to the Israel Palestine conflict is antisemitic,"And It would be the same if you decided to hate Muslims for whatever happened with the Taliban. 

EDIT: I want to add, I'm not saying Israel is the same as the Taliban, I'm just bringing up 2 geopolitical issues that have brought hatred toward both religions. I don't like Israel's current political party, however, I'm not anti-Israel, I believe in Jewish self-determination, and I also believe Palestinians are entitled to their own self-determination, to avoid confusion this is why I'm clarifying my point of view. As a Jewish person, Israel is important to me, but that doesn't mean I don't have my own views on its Pros and Cons regarding their policies, most views are grey, but they are not relevant to the argument I'm trying to make. And as I said before, I respect arguments from the opposite view regardless if I think they are right or wrong, it doesn't matter as long as there's no ill intent behind it*

I wanted to bring this up because IT IS  a loophole people are using as a cover-up. My stance on the conflict doesn't matter in this regard, but we need to bring up how damaging this whole situation has been for both sides, since I'm Jewish I won't speak for my Muslim friends, I'm sure you guys have very valid things to say about people being Islamophobic and such. 

We need to call out people that make references to the ""chosen people"" or ""never again"", comments saying, ""they were saved from genocide to commit genocide"". I've seen this in any post on Reddit that mentions Israel. People have their views on it, okay? When you equate all Jewish people in a geopolitical conflict as an argument (and, this is the loophole) you are including me and people that don't live there. Regardless of my opinion or my ties, I'm not Israeli, so why are you making me responsible for a conflict I'm not even a part of? 

This is what is antisemitic. People using this as an excuse to protest in Jewish neighborhoods (if people are saying it has nothing to do with hating on Jews and are a critique of Israel, then go protest at the Israeli embassy, there's no justification for hate crimes against Jews and vandalism of synagogues, nor comments in social media mocking Jews. How is this not antisemitic? How is it not antisemitic to spread the idea that it's all Jews when the same people are saying it's about Israel?

I am a Jewish person trying to live my life, but I have to see all these comments that defacto includes me in a conflict as a perpetrator when all I've been doing this year is working and falling in love with my boyfriend, I live in Latin America, yet I'm somehow responsible for genocide and a whole war. If it's not about the Jews, then don't make it about us.

Same applies pretty much all countries in the Americas including the US , they all came to be in the last 250 years. If we go back in history enough all countries had go start somewhere. 
Yes Palestine as an independent country doesn't exist right now but this doesn't mean it shouldn't exist in the future just because there wasn't an independent Palestine before. This point is also based on the assumption that Israel is any different. Israel is an ancient name but it's not a direct continuation of the ancient kingdom of Israel and by the way there's huge skepticism when it comes to the notion of a historical unified Kingdom of Israel ever existing. Israel as we know it today is a modern country founded in 1947-1948.",EagleSimilar2352,t2_ruckfume,0.65,36,227
1117,16dfmy4,2023-09-08,IsraelPalestine,I feel like I’m being gaslighted,"Important context- I am a Jewish young adult. During my teen years I went straight for anti-Zionism and I’m currently working my way backwards. I don’t generally consider myself a Zionist, because I feel like no one really knows what it means. But as a Jew and a student of History I know that we come from the Levant and ultimately I believe in our right to live there. My feelings on the state of Israel itself are complicated but find that I disagree with its actions more than I agree with them. 

Now onto the post: I am constantly confused and flabbergasted by people, usually who are neither Jews nor Palestinians, who will do just about anything but admit that for many anti-Zionists, the goal is to kill or exile Jews from the levant.  Of course, there are some people who will outright admit this, but many people won’t. And when I mention it, I get responses like “why is that more important than what’s happening to Palestinians” (it’s not) and “why do you think decolonization = murder that says more about you as a colonizer than anything else”. Which like. Okay?

I’m not saying that every Palestinian or everyone who supports Palestine wants to kill or exile the Jews. But the truth is, many leaders within the movement either outright say this is what they want to do or they are just extremely vague about what happens to the Jews when we free Palestine.

How about throw in what the Syrian government did in literally gassing its own people and intentionally bombing a hospital with help from Russia? There are millions of people displaced from both countries on top of a death toll in the tens of thousands of civilians.

The government of Brunei keeps its people poor while its officials are living lavishly as an oil rich nation.  Is it only considered oppression or a ""genocide"" when it's a group of non Muslims are considered the oppressors? Is it just a reason to express the hatred of Jewish people, which I have never understood the vehement hate as non religious person.

1120,16zmeyr,2023-10-04,IsraelPalestine,Roger Waters and the Pro-Palestinian Left's Blind Spot On Anti-Semitism,"There's a constant cycle in every I/P conflict discussion, in which a pro-Palestine/anti-Israel person says something, a pro-Israel person says ""that something is anti-Semitic,"" and the pro-Palestine/anti-Israel person says ""no it's not anti-Semitic and you pro-Israel people always say things are anti-Semitic to silence legitimate criticisms of Israel"". If you've spent any time in these circles, you've seen this cycle play out over and over and over again. What we're here today to determine is why does this cycle keep happening? I think I have the answer: there is a blind spot in pro-Palestinian and pro-Palestine leftists circles towards anti-Semitism, and Roger Waters is a perfect illustration of that. 

I hope by now we've all watched the documentary about Roger Waters linked [here.](https://reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/16uh6dc/the_dark_side_of_roger_waters/) If not, I highly recommend you should, because Waters and his following among the pro-Palestinian left illustrates this blind spot very well. 

Let's start with the most inflammatory part first, Waters' use of the phrase ""dirty kike"" in an email to his team. Now, the full ramifications of this haven't been felt yet, since the documentary only came out recently, but Waters freely admits that the email was his and he used the phrase to make an anti-racist point, a classic example of [hipster racism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hipster_racism). As far as I can tell, he has lost not one iota of support from his pro-Palestine leftist and Palestinian supporters. In the conversations in the previous Waters thread, we have at least one user downright defend Waters' use of it. 

Now, compare this incident to the n-word, a word downright infamous for its long legacy of virulent, obscene hatred. Compare Waters to Michael Richards, who used the n-word numerous times as part of a comedy routine in 2006 and hasn't been heard from since. To Louis CK, who used the word in an unearthed clip and received a firestorm of criticism. The NAACP states that ""the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People shall not condone, award, or engage any person that uses the N-word in any capacity"". For the left, the n-word is beyond the pale. Using it today or in the past is seen as the ultimate sin of which there should be no coming back. ""Kike"", on the other hand, seems to be just fine for a non-Jewish white man who hates Israel and Zionists to use. 

Let's review another one of Waters' greatest ""hits."" 

In an interview in August 2022, Waters said the state of Israel believes in ""...religious supremacy, the idea that the Jewish people are somehow superior to everybody else on the planet but particularly the Arabs, the Palestinian Arabs...the Israeli state who believe that the Jewish people are superior, more important than any of those people, those people’s lives are worthless"".

[The idea that Jews believe ""Jewish people are superior"" to other people and nations is an anti-Semitic trope going back centuries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews_as_the_chosen_people#Ethnocentrism). It was an intrinsic part of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion and 

> According to the record of a 1984 hearing before the Subcommittee on Human Rights and International Organizations in the US Congress concerning Soviet Jewry: **This vicious anti-Semitic canard, frequently repeated by other Soviet writers and officials, is based upon the malicious notion that the ""Chosen People"" of the Torah and Talmud preaches ""superiority over other peoples"", as well as exclusivity.**

So when Roger Waters repeats an anti-Semitic myth ALMOST word for word, but says ""Israel"" believes it instead of ""Jews"" believe it, Jews take issue with what he says. The pro-Palestinian left, though, seems to have no issue with it whatsoever, because hey, hey, hey he said ""Israel!"" He didn't say Jews! So it's totally fine! That is the argument they seriously make. 

This is the same left, by the way, who can find racism in [commonplace hand gestures](https://www.npr.org/2019/09/26/764728163/the-ok-hand-gesture-is-now-listed-as-a-symbol-of-hate), [Netanyahu's comments about how the elections are going](https://www.politico.com/story/2015/03/benjamin-netanyahu-arab-voter-turnout-116142), and [voter ID laws.](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/impact-voter-suppression-communities-color), as well as every Israeli law that they don't like, such as [having menorahs on postage stamps](https://www.adalah.org/en/law/view/539). When it comes to people the pro-Palestinian left doesn't like, like Israelis/Zionists and American right-wingers, the standard of proof of racism is very, very low. When it comes to people the pro-Palestinian left does like, like Roger Waters, the standard of proof is very, very high. 

Let's do one more example.

Roger Waters said in the CAA documentary quoting [his appearance on a Palestinian news site](https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?v=1198625650480085&ref=watch_permalink) that Sheldon Adelson, a wealthy Jewish billionaire, was a “puppet master” who was “filling the coffers and pulling all the strings” of the Trump administration. He also repeated the superiority myth, stating that Adelson  “believes that only Jews, only Jewish people, are completely human…and everybody else on Earth is there to serve them.” He has used the idea of ""puppet master"" before, stating in [another interview quoted in CAA](https://www.thejc.com/news/news/roger-waters-claims-cripple-labour-mp-is-working-for-his-masters-in-tel-aviv-01wgrrPZMP5TH9SIJ87K6Q) that a non-Jewish Labour MP in Britain was working for ""his masters in the Foreign Office of Tel Aviv.""

[The idea of Jews being shadowy conspirators controlling world governments with their Jewish money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Jewish_conspiracy) has been described as ""the most widespread and durable conspiracy theory of the twentieth century"". It was deployed by French anti-republicans in the late 19th century, it's another main theme of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, and was republished by Henry Ford in his work ""The International Jew: the World's Foremost Problem."" More recently, it's a belief held by many white supremacist groups in the United States and Europe, including by David Duke himself, [who stated](https://www.algemeiner.com/2023/05/31/former-kkk-leader-david-duke-urges-solidarity-with-roger-waters-amid-antisemitism-row-over-singers-concerts-in-germany/) that Roger Waters was being unfairly attacked for ""for daring to expose Israel’s crimes and the crimes of the Jewish-controlled US government and media"".

Again, when Roger Waters says that a Jewish billionaire and the Jewish state are controlling the world's governments, Jewish groups say ""Wow, that sounds exactly like the international Jewish conspiracy anti-Semitic trope,"" the pro-Palestine left responds as one with ""NO NO NO! He didn't say 'JEWS', he said 'A JEWISH BILLIONAIRE AND THE JEWISH STATE.' That's totally fine and not anti-Semitic at all!""

Thus, the blind spot is clear and obvious. Waters has said and continues to make statements that are 99% anti-Semitic, but his supporters cling to that 1% that's not and declare he's completely in the clear. This is a standard that does not exist for any other marginalized minority and for any other spewer of hatred and racist tropes. For his supporters in the comments section below, they are leaping right now to prove my point. I've had conversations with a couple of them already and they've shown this exact issue. They literally do not see any issues with these tropes Waters is pushing.

So TL;DR: This cycle of ""You're anti-Semitic!"" and ""No, I'm not, you're just saying that to silence legitimate criticism!"" is bound to continue for as long as there's an Arab-Israeli conflict, and possibly beyond, because the pro-Palestine left will not and cannot recognize the anti-Semitism among the ranks and the pro-Israel groups will not and cannot let the anti-Semitic tropes deployed by them go by unanswered.

1121,13z68bl,2023-06-03,IsraelPalestine,"""WHY DON'T ISRAELI PRO-DEMOCRACY PROTESTERS WAVE PALESTINE FLAGS OR SCREAM FREE PALESTINE""","I've heard this laughable take from several anti-Israeli publications such Young Turks, Vice News or Al-Jazeera and various individuals as they cast shade on the protests again judicial reform in Israel by accusing the participants of being 'hypocritical fascists' or 'not actually in favor of democracy' because the rallies largely feature Israeli flags, copied Arab Revolt aka 'Palestine' flags are considered provocative, and for not focusing on the occupation.

This makes no sense whatsoever. Why would you want the flag of a foreign, militant nationalist movement whose leaders haven't held elections in decades and which champions wildly far-right, fundamentalist ideals in your gathering for democratic values? As a matter of fact, nobody on planet earth who actually cares about democratic values should be waving the Arab Revolt flag, as that would make *them* the frauds.

Statistically speaking, I'm sure that at least half of the protesters might support an eventual two-state solution, but that still doesn't mean there's anything good or inspiring about the 'State of Palestine' that warrants any inclusion of their symbolism in Israeli civil society. 

As for the notion that unless a Jewish Israeli is perpetually prostrating down to Pro-Palestinian narratives and demanding immediate surrender or compliance with all of Hamas's or Fatah wishes and withdrawal from the West Bank, without any guarantees or indications of good-will from the other side, then they cannot possibly be 'Democratic' while tolerating a military occupation at the same time, that has no precedence either. Democrats ( not the party ) in the U.S did not all instantly stop being pro-democracy in 1946 because German and Japanese civilians had restricted movement and rights, mass civilian deaths, and so forth, at the behest of U.S troops, while U.S citizens had full rights. Hell the U.S even went a step further and put actual citizens of German or Japanese origin under surveillance and in camps which *does* arguably go against the principle but still called themselves a democracy, recognized as such by the UN, and no history books characterizes them as a 'non-democracy' between those years. 

Same goes for every other democratic nation in the planet engaged in conflicts with another group of peoples. The word was simply never meant to apply to non-citizens or foreign elements, it's unrelated. Once again, even so, according to polls it is highly probably that most of the protesters would still be amenable to peace negotiation with the Arab-Palestinian leadership if that sentiment was reflected back from the Palestinian street, they're just not going to waste their time on beating that dead horse when there are more pressing issues in their mind affecting them domestically.

So in short - There's nothing *inherently* contradictory or hypocritical in the way that protests in Israel have been conducted. *Some* protesters might secretly be anti-democratic and support say, annexations without citizenship, which is quite unlikely because the far-right largely supports Netanyahu in this, but these would be individual cases, not a widespread 'corruption' like Mehdi Hassan and his ilk bizarrely portray them as because their favorite 'team' is missing from the protest.

1122,13jg7hg,2023-05-16,IsraelPalestine,"In the words of Benny Morris, fir all whom tokenize him","To quote Prof. Benny Morris:

|| Israel-haters are fond of citing - and more often, mis-citing - my work in support of their arguments. Let me offer some corrections.

|| in dozens of localities around Palestine, Arab leaders advised or ordered the evacuation of women and children or whole communities, as occurred in Haifa in late April, 1948. And Haifa's Jewish mayor, Shabtai Levy, did, on April 22nd, plead with them to stay, to no avail.

|| MOST of Palestine's 700,000 ""refugees"" fled their homes because of the flail of war (and in the expectation that they would shortly return to their homes on the backs of victorious Arab invaders). 

|| The displacement of the 700,000 Arabs who became ""refugees"" - and I put the term in inverted commas, as two-thirds of them were displaced from one part of Palestine to another and not from their country (which is the usual definition of a refugee) - was not a ""racist crime""... but the result of a national conflict and a war, with religious overtones, from the Muslim perspective, launched by the Arabs themselves.

|| There was no Zionist ""plan"" or blanket policy of evicting the Arab population, or of ""ethnic cleansing"". Plan Dalet (Plan D), of March 10th, 1948 (it is open and available for all to read in the IDF Archive and in various publications), was the master plan of the Haganah - the Jewish military force that became the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) - to counter the expected pan-Arab assault on the emergent Jewish state. That's what it explicitly states and that's what it was. And the invasion of the armies of Egypt, Jordan, Syria and Iraq duly occurred, on May 15th.

|| The demonisation of Israel is largely based on lies - much as the demonisation of the Jews during the past 2,000 years has been based on lies. And there is a connection between the two.

1123,176jcqp,2023-10-12,IsraelPalestine,What would it take for Muslims to end their hatred of Jewish people?,"The massacre perpetrated by Hamas against Israel on 7 October has resulted in the deaths of over 1200 civilians, the worst in recent Israeli history. Meanwhile, Muslims around the world are joyously celebrating the event as soon as the news had broken, holding pro-Palestine protests and yelling vile anti-Semitic and religious chants in public, including in my home city of Sydney, Australia, where protesters burnt an Israeli flag and joyously yelled ""Gas the Jews!"" in front of the Sydney Opera House after it was lit up in white and blue colours.

As a non-Jewish and a non-Muslim, I find it very unsettling that members of a faith are openly celebrating mass murder of a single ethnicity without any critical thought or conscience and can only wonder whether some of them would be committed to launching terrorist attacks of their own in my city to pursue their political aims.

Having said that, consider this scenario, no matter how unlikely it may seem right now: Israel decides to grant Gaza and the West Bank full independence. No more checkpoints, no more blockade, removal of all West Bank settlements (or land swap with Arab majority areas or something similar). Palestine would get its own army and be able to defend themselves from any perceived threats, while Israel winds down some of its more harsh military policies.

1124,170s7w6,2023-10-05,IsraelPalestine,Palestinians do not deserve a state,"Edited: I added a 4th reason. 

I’m sure I’ll get a lot of flack for this, but I think it is extremely important for people to understand this:

There are 4 reasons why they don’t deserve a state of their own:

1) Palestinians are not a “People”. 

I am not saying they are not human, I am saying they are not a People in the sense of having a unique, significant, ethnicity or other classification that should make them worthy of having their own country. In fact, they never even called themselves Palestinians until the 1960’s; they considered themselves simply Arabs/Muslims. 

Palestinians have no unique language, customs, religion, culture, etc that is virtually  any different than any other Muslim Arab in the world. Jews for example are a People because they are the only ones that have a unique and shared language (Hebrew), a religion and holy book that no one else has, observances and customs that no one else has, and they are even ethically related to each other. In fact the only thing that differentiates Palestinians with the rest of Arab Muslims in the world is where they live and perhaps some variations in cooking and dress. There are already many Arab Muslims countries (including one in Palestine already - Jordan) and there is no reason there should be another one for Arab Muslims just because they live in a certain region of the world. If it is the case that any large religious group that lives in a certain part of the world should get their own county, then Jews in New England should get to have their own country, Jews in Scotland should get to have their own country, Italian Jews should get to have their own country, etc. 

2) There already is a Palestinan state. 

The British mandate for Palestine was for a Jewish country in Palestine, but the British betrayed the mandate and gave much of the land that was promised to Israel to create another Arab Muslim country, Jordan. Jordan IS the Palestinian state. So they already have one.

3) The Palestinians don’t want a state.
 
The Palestinians have rejected every offer for a state since 1947, and have made it clear that they view all of Palestine (including Israel) as Muslim land and part of the greater Muslim world. This is why at pro-Palestinian rallies the most popular chant is “from the river to the sea Palestine will be free” because they believe all the land is theirs by default so there is no need for a state. In fact, having a state would go against everything they believe because it would confirm that only a designated part of Palestine (the borders of the Palestinian state) is theirs, when they believe ALL of Palestine is theirs.

4) The Palestinians have shown they do not want to recognize Israel and do not want to live at peace with Israel as a neighbor.

In addition to the obvious historical actions of the entire Arab world not recognizing Israel, and trying to annihilate it, rhetoric (and Hamas rocket attacks and PA terrorist attacks) from both the PA and Hamas, as well as polls show that the Palestinian leaders and the vast majority of Palestinians do not recognize Israel as a legitimate country and have an ultimate goal to eradicate it. Why would the world ever give a blessing to allow a country to be formed that has as its primary objective to eradicate an established neighboring, democratic country and endanger the millions of people living there?",RepresentativeNew754,t2_7gedip7l,0.56,37,481

If you look at these events, there's one big thing you'll notice. Obviously, there are some celebrating the attack and happy about dead civilians, but that isn't what I'm talking about. I'm talking about flags.

You'll only see the flag of the State of Palestine at their rallies, being waved; there aren't any at Israel rallies. However, Israeli flags can be seen at either one of these types of protests/rallies. That's because the people at the Israel rallies will wave them, while the people at the Palestine rallies will burn them and trample them. And really, I think that sums up the two sides quite well.

People on one side are rallying for their people to survive, while people on the other side are rallying not just for their people to survive, but for the people they hate to perish. I don't know what more needs to be said about that.

1127,17gdqp4,2023-10-25,IsraelPalestine,An honest view about the current crisis.,"I mean to me it's clear : what hamas did was absolutely terrible. Its gruesome attack against isreali civilians are to be condemned and they must be annihilated. 

But frankly, I think the Israel government's response is also terrible. 

I'm opening the news daily, and all I'm seeing on the reddit subs for IsraelPalestine, Worldnews, Politics etc. is : one team who says Israel (as a whole lmao, as if they're one person) is terrible for killing innocents, and one team backlashing saying they're pro-hamas. And then it get's mixed into anti-semitism, pro-terrorists.. the list goes on.

In the midst of this confusion, we're allowing Israeli people to be blindly associated to their government and innocent palestinians to be melted to death with Hamas terrorists. Isn't time to make a distinction ? 

I'll say it again : the Israeli govt MUST retaliate. And again : Hamas killing poor Isreali people and destroying families like that is terrible. 

But would you not also condemn a government (and not a country !!) that bombs A BIT COMPULSIVELY (let's be honest here, the Israeli govt doesn't seem to give a f\*ck) a territory where you know there are kids and innocent people in the way ? That's also a no. 

Yes Hamas is hiding. Yes they're always up to no good. Yes they deserve to be put down. But man, all these children dying randomly.. I can't imagine that there's no better solution than that. 

&#x200B;

**TL;DR :** I don't understand why people are preaching for one side or another, when clearly in both sides there are children and innocent people dying, which to me is f\*\*cked up either way.

I am a gentile non-Israeli, but I support Israel strongly, I believe it has been a moral, just and legal country from the very beginning and I think Golan and Judea and Samaria belong to Israel legally and ethically, but I still have some issues against it, like

1. Ben Gvir and his fellow racist supremacist party members who stand against everything Israel was founded upon, and the fact that Israel doesn't have a constitution banning ilk like him from coming into government

2. The government endorsing thugs who build illegal outposts on literally stolen land owned by Palestinians because of extremist supremacist beliefs (I am not talking about proper settlements that have been legal by Israel for decades)

3. IDF soldiers having a taboo against hindering violence from Jews targeted at innocent Palestinians, they should be equally hindering escalation from both sides, and hinder jew raids on Palestinians from happening. It's impossible to justify videos of IDF soldiers just standing there and looking while extremists are hurting others.

4. Recently, Israel should NOT have blocked their supply of water to the Gaza strip. Hamas are animals who WILL kill/sacrifice the entire population of Gaza for their ideology, they will never surrender for water, and the remaining water will be prioritised towards soldiers, leaving civilians to die. Blocking electricity is justified, as it's helping Hamas a lot, and asking civilians to evacuate only up to 10 km away in 24 hours is imo a perfectly reasonable and good thing, but water is such a vital resource to life and life only, not war, so it boggles my mind that Israel has decided to block it.

5. Supporting Azerbaijan. It's obvious Israel does this as a move against Iran, ignoring the moral element and forsaking the budding fellow Oriental democracy of Armenia against a nation ruled by dictatorship instructing its children to hate, like the Palestinian Authority does

Anyone saying Israel just constantly steals land- you could make an argument for that in the West Bank, but in Gaza, this was a withdrawal from Palestinian land.  

2: The full blockade of Gaza started after Hamas consolidated control of the strip, as a response to thousands of rockets attacks fired indiscriminately at Israeli cities since then. Call it an open-air prison all you want, but Hamas has taken the billions upon billions of aid money and used it to dig up water pipes for rocket assembly, create 500 km of war tunnels, horde all fuel and infrastructure to benefit Hamas, and otherwise treat the people like crap. If Hamas were actually trying to create an independent Palestinian state and not devote al resources to killing Israelis, even a densely populated place like Gaza may have thrived. Everyone demonizes Israel for the blockade but no one has any solution to what to do when an enemy government wants every one of your citizens dead and will stop at nothing to do so, and said enemy government is right next to you and completely dependent on you for basic needs.

3: Had Hamas killed a bunch of soldiers on Oct 7 and taken soldier hostages, I wouldve been extremely angry. But then at least you could potentially make an argument that they were defending themselves, resistance is justified when people are occupied, etc. they went further and decided to slaughter 1000 civilians, home to home, lobbing grenades at families, burning babies alive, shooting children point blank, raping women and defiling corpses. The fact that the left thinks these actions ALSO represent ""decolonization"" and ""resistance"" is beyond the pale. There is no other conflict on Earth, not even WWII when Russians did the same to Germans, where people would cheer for such a thing.  

4: Demanding a cease fire is deeply unreasonable. Hamas said they will do Oct 7 over and over again and will rearm if there's a ceasefire. There are 200+ hostages which include literal babies. A ceasefire is simply supporting Hamas aims.  

5: Everyone is accusing Israel of genocide, but no one can actually provide an actual suggestion for what Israel should do. Hamas deliberately put its bases of operations under hospitals, uses ambulances to get around, attacks in civilian clothing, has their weapons stored in mosques and schools. What is Israel supposed to do? Calling ahead to get civilians to evacuate, creating humanitarian safe zones and escorting civilians to those areas, what more can an army possibly do to protect civilians in the context of battling an enemy like Hamas doing the above in one of the most densely populated places on Earth? What other army in modern history has made such a campaign towards getting civilians out of a battlezone? Russia? US in Iraq? Tigray? Sudan? Yemen? Myanmar? All these places where horrifying atrocities have happened, which army has made those efforts? People keep criticizing Israel but then have nothing to say other than ""Israel needs to do better"" really? All of a sudden everyone who supports Palestine is a military or munitions expert? We also have no clue how many civilians have been killed because Hamas isnt reporting their combatant casualties separately. And when they say children are dead, they're including 16 and 17 year old child soldiers.",Trudginonthrough,t2_6pna38si,0.64,36,67

But I see all the time videos of stuff like Israelis, beating up Palestinians, and I agree as much as foreigners that, these guys are disgusting humans, and I’m ashamed of them, but it’s videos like these that people pay attention too, as I said I do not think Israel is innocent, with propaganda to war crimes, but Palestine has been doing horrible things to us too, people just don’t pay attention to it . A couple nights ago, a guy got shot in a terror attack here, and occasionally they launch missiles at us. 

These are just small examples of what they do to us, and what I stated of Israel doing to Palestine is just small examples. The point of this post is to address that Israel and Palestine are both brainwashed countries that hate each other, personally I don’t hate Palestinians at all, but some of my family members do, and trust me when I say it’s pointless to try to talk to them about it. 

Personally I think the best solution (a very hard to impossible solution) is by merging Israel and Palestine together, with our combined people, as unrealistic as it is, I don’t believe in splitting the land, both sides have good reasons, on why the land is “theirs”. I truly hope for peace in both countries, and I’m just sharing my perspective from the Israeli side. 🇮🇱☮️🇵🇸",Idunnoausernameok,t2_rsp9v1i7,0.81,36,87

After World War I, the British Empire gained control of the territory that is now Israel and Palestine through the League of Nations' mandate system. The area was known as the British Mandate for Palestine, and this mandate was established in 1920, following the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire.

The British Mandate for Palestine was governed under the terms of the League of Nations' mandate system, which aimed to prepare territories for self-government while maintaining the peace and security of the region. The mandate for Palestine was unique in that it included a commitment to the establishment of a ""national home for the Jewish people"" in Palestine, as outlined in the Balfour Declaration of 1917.

During the mandate period, tensions between the Jewish and Arab populations in Palestine grew. The Jewish population, which had been immigrating to the region for decades, increased significantly. Arab residents were concerned about the impact of Jewish immigration on their political and economic status. This tension led to conflicts and violence between the two communities.

The British authorities struggled to manage the situation, and the Mandate period was marked by ongoing violence, uprisings, and tensions between Jewish and Arab communities. After World War II and the Holocaust, the pressure to create a Jewish state intensified, and the British Mandate for Palestine became increasingly untenable.

In 1947, the United Nations approved a partition plan for Palestine, which recommended the division of the territory into separate Jewish and Arab states, with international administration of Jerusalem. The plan was accepted by Jewish leaders but rejected by Arab leaders. This eventually led to the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, resulting in the establishment of the State of Israel and the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinian Arabs.

The British Mandate for Palestine formally ended on May 14, 1948, when the State of Israel declared its independence. After that, Israel and its neighboring Arab states continued to be in conflict over issues related to borders, refugees, and the status of Jerusalem, which continues to this day. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict remains a significant issue in the region's geopolitics.",Resident_Fisherman22,t2_8vr1oame,0.87,17,8
1135,17qspof,2023-11-08,IsrealPalestineWar_23,What options does Israel have in Gaza besides doing what they currently are?,"Disclaimer: I'm not saying that the things going on in Palestine aren't horrible, but hear me out.

I don't really see any other thing Israel could do. The majority of Gaza supports Hamas, seeing that they voted them into power. If Israel just ""frees Gaza"" Gaza will try to completely push Israel out of the middle east. So what can they do? 

The only answer is for Gaza to stop wanting to destroy Israel.

People might say that Israel should stop the bombings, which I agree with to an extent, but they aren't just targeting civilians. They are targeting Hamas leaders, and civilians are also very sadly getting killed.

Another issue is that Hamas isn't just a small group, it's the government of Gaza. It really is Gaza  to a large extent.

The only other options I see is for Israel to either stop they're invasion and continue suffering terrorists attacks and raids, or to only use ground operations to hunt down Hamas leaders, which isn't really a viable option. It would make it much much harder to get rid of Hamas that way, and they would probably end up losing or suffering mass casualties.

Edit: after seeing everyone's sides, I understand things slightly better now. Essentially, what I have got from this is that because Israel really hates Hamas and because Hamas is very spread out , Israel is being reckless about it causing innocent deaths, which needs to be changed.

Everything I am finding seems to have a bias undertone. So I thought I’d look to a large group to get a basic understanding. So if anyone knows history this is probably you who I’m asking these questions to. 

And I also know this has a lot of nuances I don’t understand but I’m looking for a jumping off point. 

Here is what I understand: Israel and Palestine are in a war over territory. This territory has both religious and historical significance to both sides. The British after WW1 created a massive tension between the two when the land was claimed. 

What i don’t understand: what was happening between them BEFORE WW1 if it’s been that unstable there this long it seems unlikely that it just popped off after WW1. In explaining to me like a 10 year old, what exactly did the British do by dividing this territory that caused so many issues? It doesn’t make sense to me that they would do this division of territory that no one really seemed okay with and being like “yep. That seems good!”

I don’t think that’d accomplish a damn thing, if anything it would hinder Palestines efforts to defend their country from the oppression placed on them by the Israeli government. Thus putting the power of the Palestine back into the hands of their self appointed leader who in their eyes does not fight for their people’s rights and freedom. I mean look at how much the Palestinian people are suffering, didn’t Israel just last week turn their water back on after cutting the Palestinian people from it? which is in fact something that has happened multiple times over the years. Do Israel bomb hospitals for the past year and either own it, or in time say it’s a HAMAS failed attack?  Allen to just go left unchecked without proof or investigations actually taking place. I think the only way that this can be seen as religious issue is in the eyes of the Israeli government for trying to shun the ideas of the Palestinian people. Keep going.

Imagine, only for a second if in the US, another government had control of our water and power and they cut us off from it whenever they felt like it. (I’m aware that that could never happen, open your mind pls)  It would be absolute chaos in our country, looting, protests, riots, etc. why? because our own people in government positions would not be standing up for us allowing us to truly fight for ourselves and establish our freedom. This is what is going on in the minds of the Palestinian people. Hamas are merely made up of Palestines strongest individuals, freedom fighters if you will, their sole purpose is to end this oppression and control over their people so they can live their own lives. free from other governments dictating when they eat, when they drink, when they sleep, and what they are taught. It’s all corrupt and I encourage people to read between the lines of what the media chooses to show us. you’re telling me that us Americans take our own news w a grain of salt because some people have “hidden agendas” but all of the sudden when a war starts finally getting talked about because people start seeing the corruption, we’re international relations experts as if everything the media shows us is 100% true and factual. 

(Here’s a hot take) I refuse to follow it blindly, this to me looks like history repeating its self. Take the way America a longgggg time ago pushed out the Native Americans from the country they had inhabited before because they couldn’t defend themselves. Palestine (Hamas)(Palestines strongest individuals) doesn’t need to bomb Israel and kill everyone, and I don’t believe that is their mission. I think they just want the freedom to live for themselves and until that side gets talked about they will keep fighting.

obviously isreal is not a saint but i just dont buy this whole victim mentality of Palestine .isreal was in the same and even worst state when all the arab world attacked it right after its independance yet no one was so crying about it like ppl are now for Palestine rn

the whole settler thing is weird as well, just bez the jews in todays isreal were migrants once does not mean they cant have a seprate land , muslims in the subcontinent were settlers too but they got pakistan lol . and it seems kind of contradictory for a muslims to support pakistan and not support isreal at the same time since both have same shitty history technically . 

&#x200B;

either way in short i feel like the dying babies are being cashed by a country which is suffering bez of its own fked government and bad decisions which they elected and support . they lost a war twice and lost most of their land as a result , they did it again and are suffering coz of it

And even when you share ,that person will tell you when you can use the toilet when you can use the kitchen when he is capable to do everything he wants .And when you decided to stand up for yourself and fight for your home you become the villain.
I am not saying what Hamas did is good, but the israelites government doing the same thing and even worse all the time , the Israeli police storm al-Aqsa mosque all the time kicking and hurting the Palestinians , they keep evacuating the people from their houses . They killed and tortured and arrested people with false accusations.But even after all of that the usa ,france ,uk and countries like them didn't say a thing.And when Hamas did what they did , i am seeing people losing their shit over it, when those same people  did nothing when the israelites government did all of those things.
I see people supporting Ukraine and saying that Palestine deserves all of that .
Even in sports man that where we suppose not to include politics , when Russia invaded Ukraine they banned them from basically most sport and some Russian athletes were harassed, and other players will post about supporting Ukraine and no one will say a thing.But now when a player in a soccer teams posts about isreal no one will bother him and when another player posts about Palestine he will get harassed from his team and the country.France and the usa always talking about freedom of speech ,but when it comes to Palestine nahh man you can't support them no more of freedom of speech ,This hypocrisy is sooo frustrating.
As a Christian person that meet a lot of muslims and Jewish i saw nothing bad from those religions the people that i meet were wonderful. Just because 1 in 10 muslims is bad doesn't mean Islam is bad.Just because 1 in 10 jew is bad doesn't mean judaisme is bad.
I do believe that both parties deserves to live happily and in peace.

Could they take full control? no way, look at Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan.. its simply not possible.

What they can threaten to  do is remove military ability and destroy power and infrastructure to the point a nation can no longer function. American military is a nation to nation force.

What they could do is force peace on both sides, they could decide that hate and emotion will not run wild. Israel has now already had an eye for an eye in this battle, and truly both sides are now blind with hate.

They could stop Israel, ( they could not stop Hamas without doing the same as Israel) they could enforce an end to Israel's intention to remove Palestine from the map.

Of course it would need all other Middle East nations to agree to end hostilities and accept both Israel and Palestine as nations.  Faced with destruction of/in the middle east of a wider war it would be a better option for those with money and power, even if they have no compassion..

Or we all look the other way as Israel commits mass murder with far superior weapon systems that cannot in the long term achieve anything but more hate and war.  Doing nothing is  the worst option, it condemns us all to history.

Israel was officially established as a state on May 14, 1948, following the United Nations' approval of a plan to partition the British Mandate of Palestine into separate Jewish and Arab states. This establishment of Israel marked a significant event in the conflict.

The Palestinian Arab population has lived in the region for centuries, and their presence in historic Palestine predates the establishment of the modern state of Israel. Many Palestinians trace their history and connection to the land back for generations.

2) all settlers are removed from the above Palestinian borders. 

3) Jerusalem remains Israeli land but the disputed religious points are put under the control of an international body created of Christians,Jews, and Muslims. This would be the hard one to hammer out but having the major Islamic cultural and religious sites not under control of Israel would need to happen for lasting peace. 

After this is all established, the strong nations of the world should agree to go to war against any nation who attacks Israel as well as Israel if they attack Palestine. 



So, what do y’all think of my shower thoughts idea? What points do you agree or disagree with and why?

For those like me, who are only now starting to learn more about it, after watching tens of different videos and reading a dozen articles I selected 4 most informative videos that helped me understand the context of the situation in the region. 

Here is the playlist with those videos: [https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDG9ZIsBWsTTkxwjp947Pdw7x7vnduF-I&si=1O6wLtpA32DuZytI](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDG9ZIsBWsTTkxwjp947Pdw7x7vnduF-I&si=1O6wLtpA32DuZytI)  


What are those videos: 

There is a recent Piers Morgan interview of Bassem Youssef - a Egyptian comedian and a TV show host which does a great job of exposing the absurdity of the double standard in the western media when talking about this conflict.

The other 3 videos (total duration of all 3 together is about 30 minutes) are made by Al-Jazeera Plus (a company owned by Al-Jazeera) which is clearly not completely unbiased, but for sure is professional. The three 10-minute videos cover the history of the Israel and Palestine and the conditions on the ground over the years. 

Admittedly, these videos cover a pro-palestinian point of view. However, it's a very professional overview.

**I'll be happy if people also challenge things covered in these videos and maybe give a pro-Israeli view playlist covering the same things, but please if you make any arguments try to bring professional sources.**  


Right now I don't see how Israel has much ground in their arguments as soon as the Zionist zealots promise is is removed or deemed illegal.  ",kid_ghibli,t2_5vwovzzf,0.45,0,2

1191,17l8old,2023-11-01,IsrealPalestineWar_23,You want a brief history on Israel / Palestine?,"I'll start in the early 1900's with the ottoman empire. Prior to the ottomans there was a cast system in Palestine with Jewish folks being the bottom of the barrel...the order went something like this: Muslims, Christian, Greek, Jew...

The ottoman than brought in equality and made everyone equal. (It was actually, the Greeks who were very mad and didn't want to be on the same level of the Jews)

There were conflicts but Jews, Muslims and Christians lived in peace together. They were synagogues churches and mosques that existed altogether and there were no wars. 

The brits took over the ottoman empire, and they still maintained a level of peace between everyone. jewish folks actually thrived. Muslims, Catholics and Greeks all live in peace with the jewish population. 

Then after world war II, the brits were mandated to give that land up and the UN and League of Nations handed over Palestinian territories to the Jews. In less than a year the Jews did something called the naqba. Which was the systematic murder of all Palestinian women and children. Then the illegal occupation of their land and the herding of over 1 million Palestinians, into the Gaza strip into what is now the largest concentration camp humanity has ever seen.

For the rest of Palestinians still left in Israel, Nazi Zionist Israel apartheid/slavery was implemented. Which is still happening to this day at a incomprehensible level.

After 70 or so years of this treatment, a group called Hamas was created within the concentration camp of the gaza strip. They were the born refugee kids of the naqba Holocaust, if you will. People were herded and forced into a concentration camp where they are starved out to die. A  group of people banded together and call themselves to Hamas, with a goal of breaking out of the concentration camp and becoming regular human beings, not slaves and subhumans as the Zionist regime wants them to be.

This brings us to today. Now you have the fourth largest and most powerful army on planet Earth that is backed up and funded by the #1 largest, most technologically advanced, and most dangerous army on planet Earth. And together they oppress a people who are stuck in open air prison and in a concentration camp, who are subjugated, starved and are left to die. 

That is the reality of israel, that is the truth .. you don't believe me. These are all Jews, a rabbi, a journalist, and and IDF member all telling you the truth! Listen up!

Those that are part of said group have attacked and beat and spit and harrased not just Muslims but also Christians and foreigners, and think about this, it wasn't until they started attacking Christians that the police finally got involved because a group of nuns had been servely beaten in the streets and left for dead, and so much more, now what is the point of this, how can we stand here and say boohoo Israel is under attack, but they were literally doing everything possible to egg on Hamas, of course I agree that Hamas are evil and they should and will be held accountable and should die for what they have done, but shoot, if you piss on my face, hurt my mom and dad and siblings, and oppress me, and I'm trapped in a bowl and have nowhere to go, I might go crazy too and start a war against the people who laughed at my mom getting beat and pissed on my face.

1197,17ffy08,2023-10-24,Israel_Palestine,"For all you calling Israel ""colonists and occupiars""","I'm not sure you're aware of our perspective. 

I think you're also mistaken in saying we took land from 'Paleistine'. 
My friend, there was no existing country. As a matter of fact, there were no ""countries"" in the middle east in the late 1800s. Palestine was a territory with no clear borders within the ottoman empire. After that it was a territory of the British empire with borders decided by European powers. Britain invented the country of Jordan by chopping Palestine in half. So no ""country"" was ever occupied by us. You want colonizers? Look at Europe, not the Jews. We were not interested in having land for land's sake, for money or resources. We're interested in coming back to our homeland. And before the state of Israel every inch of Jewish land was bought with cash, not conquered. And it was the malarial swampland that was primary sold to us. Not the rich arable lands. But we didn't care, as long as we were home. 

You think Jews are foreign colonizers with no connection to the land? Please consider the following: 

1. The foundations of jewish history- biblical and post- biblical, center around the land of israel. With the exception of a few decades of exile in babylonia there was a jewish state in the land of israel up until the roman empire conquered the land and renamed it syria palestina

2..Though Jews have moved all around the world for centuries since our exile, there has been a continuous jewish presence in Israel through the ages

3.  Nearly every single Jewish holiday is connected in some way to the land of Israel

4.  Jewish literature over centuries and generations is replete with mentions of the importance of the land of israel, our exile, and our eventual return

5. Jewish weddings- do you know why we break a glass? Its a commemoration of the destruction of the temple in jerusalem. The point of the custom is to demonstrate that even in our time of greatest joy we still mourn our exile from the land. In traditional weddings the verse “if i forget thee, jerusalem let my right hand be forgotten is sung beforehand”

6. Jewish prayer, three times a day for nearly two thousand years, makes multiple mentions of our desire to return to jerusalem and the land of israel

7. In Jewish law, produce grown in Israel takes on a special status and specific rituals  apply to them. There are jewish laws of agriculture that apply to the land of israel and nowhere else on earth

8.  Every year traditional jews observe tisha b’av, a fast day in which we mourn the destruction of Jerusalem and our exile from the land of Israel. 

9. Throughout Jewish history these have been many rabbis, community leaders, and communities that have preached the importance of returning to the land and even made their own efforts to return.

Zionism did not invent the idea of Jews returning to the land, it merely rode the wave of emerging nationalism of nations breaking away from colonial powers in order galvanize the resources and Jewish people en masse.

I cannot emphasize this enough - the narrative about Jews being colonizers is wrong. It also makes peace impossible, because peace with a colonizer is surrender. It also assumes that if the Jews are pressed hard enough they will leave. 

I promise you, we will not leave. The only thing that will happen if we keep being attacked is more war.

Yes, people were displaced when Israel was established, for several reasons. Yes, Israel destroyed Palestinian villages. We can discuss the wrongs of history and how to move forward. But to call us colonizers? Unhelpful and incorrect. 

And that's when it ends. When you stop calling us that, recognize that just as Palestinians have history here, so do Jews. And THEN we can talk.

1198,11dcjgp,2023-02-27,Israel_Palestine,Ali Abunimah and Electronic Intifada Declare Remembering the Holocaust is Anti-Palestinian,"Ali Abunimah, as one of the highest profile Palestinians and critics of Israel out there, recently took to [the pages of his website Electronic Intifada](https://electronicintifada.net/blogs/ali-abunimah/reclaiming-holocaust-memory-zionism) to come after, everyone say it with me: Holocaust memorials.

Yes, according to Ali, “Holocaust memory is no longer about actually remembering the victims of the European genocide, but about weaponizing their memory to justify the dispossession and persecution of the Palestinians”.

As we all know, literally everything on Earth is really about the Palestinians, and the Holocaust is no exception. Now, why does Ali think Holocaust memorials are really for justifying persecution of the Palestinians? Well, you can read the article to find out, but it’s extremely long, so I’ll give you the bullet points.

Point 1: Some EU officials believe that the Holocaust was a foundational part of the creation of the EU and that remembering it is “a cornerstone of European values.” Ali disputes whether or not this is actually true.

Point 2: The EU “officially equates”, Ali's words not mine, remembering the Holocaust with support for Israel. Ali’s evidence for this is that the Israeli President was present at an EU Holocaust memorial event and that the EU president said “The European Union and Israel are tied by a close friendship based on a shared history and common values of democracy, open society and rule of law.”

That’s it. That’s all the evidence Ali has. Did you read anything about the justification about the persecution of the Palestinians? No, you did not. All you read, and you can go read his original article if you don’t believe me, is that the EU remembers the Holocaust and the EU likes Israel. 

We see here yet another example of the kind of maximalist, black and white, you’re either with us or against mentality that is so prevalent in Palestine and among its supporters. Simply having Israelis present at a Holocaust memorial and not hating Israel as much as Ali does is equivalent to “justifying the dispossession and persecution of the Palestinians.” Because everything is all about the Palestinians. 

Naturally, though, being friends with Palestine or Palestinians doesn’t mean you support Palestinian war crimes, mass murder, and terrorism. Of course not. It just means you want Palestinians to be free. Funny how these things work. 

How sad that Jews and their friends cannot even commemorate the Holocaust without being accused of holding anti-Palestinian views. This is what true hate looks like.

> Amazing post by Hussain Abdul-Hussain @hahussain keep posting it everywhere you can!

> ""As Arabs, our message to the world cannot be restricted to eliciting global sympathy for the children of Gaza. We cannot depict ourselves as helpless children, behind whom we hide our failure to control our Hamas thugs who massacred 1300 non-combatant Israelis. This is a moral failure that the world sees but that we try to hide behind the “rights of the Palestinian people,” rights that none of us are willing to articulate. Free Palestine can mean anything, from an Arab Palestinian state living in peace next to Jewish Israel to an Arab Palestinian state instead of Jewish Israel.

> For Arab Israeli peace to happen, and since Palestinians are either children, or Hamas thugs, or useless corrupt Mahmud Silicon-Face Abbas, non-Palestinian Arabs should step up to save the Palestinians from themselves and save the region ongoing sorrow. We, Arabs, have to show the world that we are at peace with the idea of a Jewish state, that we are willing to concede what we believe – rightly or wrongly -- is ours (1948 territory), that we genuinely want bygones to be bygones, without secretly holding grudges and passing them to our children. We must seek a better future for ourselves and our kids, as well as for Israelis and their kids.

> The Palestine disaster (nakba) is not a disaster of land loss or military defeat. It is a disaster of absence of leadership that can articulate the Arab alternative to war and death. We ask the world to stop the Israeli war on Hamas, but what do we offer as an alternative to stopping the war? Just let those Hamas thugs who massacred 1300 Israelis get away with their crime (because there is a history of dispute)? Ask Israel to go back to October 6? Knowing that Hamas can break out of the Gaza fence and repeat its massacre any minute? Hamas must go. We Arabs must help get rid of it, and most importantly, we must show that we have a plan for the day after Hamas.

> Let’s learn from the mistake of Iraq and Arab Spring countries, that once what we have is gone, what comes next looks worse. Let’s preempt the worse by offering the better.

> As long as we, the Arabs, do not have answers to all these questions, the world will manage things without us. It does not matter if all of us, 1.3 billion Muslims, think that Israel is at fault. What matters is global perception, which clearly thinks that Islamist terrorism is the problem, not Israelis dancing at a music festival. And we, the Arabs, are not even talking to the world. We are talking to each other, patting ourselves on the back for being utopian and principled on Palestine, while we are in fact idiotically out of touch with reality. We insist on our backward message, then act surprised why many of our states are failing and why we are migrating in droves.

> Please stop treating Palestine like religion, like we have to stick to our principles to win credit in the afterlife and to garner social acceptance among each other (Arabs and/or Muslims). Please think of Palestine like a problem that requires troubleshooting, compromise, pragmatism, and most importantly, looking toward the future, not the past.""",Skkkjbmldihbdlsvvukb,t2_8j5n3m10,0.77,23,73
1202,11askel,2023-02-24,Israel_Palestine,White Supremacists Adopt Palestine's Rhetoric and Tactics,"We discussed a couple of months ago about [how neo-Nazis love the BDS movement](https://reddit.com/r/Israel_Palestine/comments/zrnhfv/haaretz_why_neonazis_love_the_bds_movement_so_much/), and this past week two more examples of American white supremacists adopting Palestine's rhetoric and tactics have emerged.

First [we have members of the ""Goyim Defense League""](https://www.jpost.com/diaspora/antisemitism/article-732553) waiting outside the entrance to a Chabad to harass the Jews coming out. Check out the video, which they proudly filmed themselves. Yes, they say things like ""Filthy Jew"", ""Heil Hitler"" and ""don't you think you should be in an oven"", but they also say the following phrases:

""Go back to Israel, you know, where you bomb Palestinian kids""
""8 billion dollars a year [to Israel]""
""You kill Palestinians!""

It seems very unlikely that these men actually care about Palestinians, as they are literal white supremacists, but they do find them useful tools to defame and attack Jews. As we all know, complaining about US aid to Israel and accusations about killing Palestinian kids are key staples in Palestine's rhetoric, and white supremacists have seen how far that kind of rhetoric has taken Palestine.

After that, we have [a ""day of hate""](https://www.timesofisrael.com/us-jews-on-alert-as-white-supremacists-plan-antisemitic-day-of-hate-saturday/) throughout the United States planned by white supremacist groups for tomorrow, Saturday, February 25th, 2023.

> The white supremacists have called for followers to distribute antisemitic messaging with banners, stickers, fliers and graffiti....“Take a stand, and expose the international clique of parasitic vermin that infest our nation,” said a statement attributed to the hate groups. “Make your voices heard loud and clear, that the one true enemy of the American people is the Jew.”

A senior Lebanese official said Hamas, which is estimated to number between 35,000 and 40,000, had enough stocked away to keep fighting for three to four months without resupply.

> While the blockade has left Gaza’s roughly 2 million people scraping by with what little food and water they scrounge up, it does not yet appear to have begun to degrade Hamas’s ability to fight.

> Hamas has said little of its supply situation — combatants rarely do — but the government it runs in Gaza says it has an emergency fuel stockpile that is quickly being depleted. “Hospitals, the ambulances and fire fighters’ machinery and civil defense trucks have been using the government emergency fuel store,” said Salama Marouf, who runs the government’s media office in Gaza.

> Fuel has taken on growing importance in recent days. Israel has so far refused to allow any fuel to be delivered to Gaza, even as other aid begins to trickle in, leaving much of the enclave without electricity to power hospitals, desalinate or pump water, fire bakers’ ovens and run internet and cellphone services. The United Nations, which handles the bulk of humanitarian relief work in Gaza, said on Thursday that it “has almost exhausted its fuel reserves and begun to significantly reduce its operations.”",OmOshIroIdEs,t2_4yj0q2gd,0.77,19,68
1206,zb89ta,2022-12-03,Israel_Palestine,"No, the Nakba was not justified. The Palestinians weren't going to genocide the Jews.","While (most) Zionists don't deny the Nakba occurred, they've instead opted into justifying the expulsion of 700,000 Palestinians. Let's break down their arguments.

&#x200B;

""The Palestinians were going to kill us! They deserved it; we needed to get them before they got us.""

This might be a convincing argument if you believed that right before the Nakba, in 1947, Palestinians were on an anti-Jewish rampage against innocent Jews. But if you read the history, the truth gets revealed. 

&#x200B;

By 1947, relations between the Jewish and Palestinian communities were abysmal. Though violence and tensions between them had started in the 1920s, since the Palestinian uprising against the British (which was supported by Jewish political institutions and Zionist militias) and the resulting White Paper (which rejected the partition plan suggested by the Peel Commission) triggered an uprising by Zionist militias (the Hagana, Lehi and Irgun). 

&#x200B;

These Zionist militias would employ brutal tactics against the British, even going so far as killing people they suspected of being collaborators and informants for the British. On November 19th 1947, Lehi assassinated five members of the Shubaki family, Palestinian civilians who Lehi accused of acting as informants. As retaliation, on November 30th, 1947 a bus was attacked by Palestinian militants, killing 7 Jews. These 2 attacks would serve as the spark for the resulting civil war. Bombings, shootings, and sabotage would occur with increasing frequency.  

&#x200B;

In between these 2 events, on the 29th, the UN passed Resolution 181, suggesting a partition of Palestine into a Jewish state and an Eastern state. From November 1947 to May 1948, the finals year of the Mandate, civil order completely dissolved. Zionist militias saw the Resolution as an opportunity to start building their state, while Palestinian militias ( the Army of the Holy War led by al-Husayni) continued to engage in attacks. 

&#x200B;

At this point, revisionists will go ""See! The Palestinians were trying the genocide the Jews! The Nakba was justified! They started it!"" But this is completely wrong. 

&#x200B;

The Palestinian community was 1.2 million, while the Jewish population was 630 thousand. Despite outnumbering Jews 2:1, the Zionist militias outnumbered the Palestinian militias 5:1 (rising to over 10:1 by May 1948).

&#x200B;

While Ben-Gurion declared conscription for the Jewish community, al-Husayni's army (Army of the Holy War) had only 5-10 thousand men, which included the thousands of volunteers from neighboring Arab states. Estimates of Palestinians who joined the fighting is around 3-5 thousand.

For those who like math, that means around 0.41% of Palestinians engaged in fighting, while around 3% of Jews were engaged in fighting. 

&#x200B;

In fact, some Zionist leaders commented on the lack of the Palestinians' will to fight.

On January 4th 1948, Ezra Danin (head of the Arab intelligence in the Haganah) said to Eliyahu Sasson (member of the Transfer committee and later Israeli politician):

*To second question Danin replied that the Arab masses seemed to have reluctantly accepted partition, although they feared Jewish rule. Their military campaign would peter out unless Arab countries intervened.*

On December 14th, 1947, David Ben Gurion said 

*""As for Arabs of Palestine — the Mufti, Haj Amin al-Husseini, has achieved dominant position, while opposition is discouraged and inactive. For time being, the mass of fellahin are not taking part in acts of violence. The Arabs, though more daring than before, are not well organized, and are economically more vulnerable than they had been.""*

&#x200B;

But the most damning evidence against this claim were the numerous peace agreements between Jews and Palestinians during this time.

*Secretary-General having failed to materialize, a meeting was held on 5 May in Jericho attended by: a) on behalf of the Commission — the American Consul in Jerusalem (Wasson) and the Commission’s Secretary (Roscher Lund); b) on behalf of the Arab League — Taqi al-Din Sulh (Adviser at the League Secretariat) and Hussein Saraj (Transjordanian Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs). The Arab representatives agreed to a truce in the entire municipal area of Jerusalem, on condition that the city did not serve as a base for military operations and that the parties evacuate all territory since the beginning of hostilities. Sulh refused to agree to the opening all the Jerusalem—Tel Aviv road.  He also refused to guarantee the maintenance of the water supply to Jewish Jerusalem, but argued that there was no danger that a pipeline serving both sides would be cut off. The Arab representatives agreed that there should be free access to the Holy Places, including the Wailing Wall. Sulh proposed the establishment of a committee representing the three religious communities to deal with municipal affairs and supervise the truce.*

More controversial, however, was the question of whether military force should be used to thwart a two-state solution. In 1947, most Arabs in Mandatory Palestine were opposed to war. Tens of thousands of them had found work in Jewish-dominated economic sectors such as citrus fruit production. Moreover, they were aware of the Zionists’ military strength. As Ben-Gurion noted in February 1948, “most of the Palestinian Arabs refused, and still refuse, to be drawn into fighting.”[10](https://jcpa.org/article/aftershock-nazi-war-jews-1947-1948-could-war-middle-east-prevented/#_ftn10) In his groundbreaking study of Palestinian collaborators, Hillel Cohen introduces many examples of stubborn resistance on the part of Palestinian Arabs to their leaders’ calls to arms, of non-aggression pacts with nearby Jewish communities and of denial of assistance to the Mufti’s forces. There were even cases where Arabs actively supported Jewish fighters.[11](https://jcpa.org/article/aftershock-nazi-war-jews-1947-1948-could-war-middle-east-prevented/#_ftn11) There was a similar absence of war-like intentions in the Arab League states of Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Transjordan, Syria, Yemen and Iraq. In August 1946, the Jewish Agency reported that “the Egyptians agree that there is no other acceptable solution to the Palestine question except partition.” [12](https://jcpa.org/article/aftershock-nazi-war-jews-1947-1948-could-war-middle-east-prevented/#_ftn12)

 *Yet in spite of the strike initiated by the Arab Higher Committee, available sources note that Judeo-Arab relations remained relatively calm at the time, in contrast to the strong tensions between the British and the Zionists, which were generating internal divisions within the Zionist movement. The many non-aggression pacts passed between Palestinian towns or villages on one hand, and the Haganah or Jewish settlements on the other, prompt us not to interpret community relations purely in terms of the conflict framework.*

&#x200B;

*From:* [*https://againstthecurrent.org/atc015/palestine-the-truth-about-1948/*](https://againstthecurrent.org/atc015/palestine-the-truth-about-1948/) 

*b) The Palestinian Arabs united under the Mufti’s leadership to foil the partition scheme. In fact, the Mufti did not enjoy much popular support and all his efforts to organize a popular resistance to the Partition Resolution proved unavailing. This is not to say that the Palestinian Arabs supported the division of their homeland, only that they were reconciled to its inevitability.*

*Ezra Danin, a Zionist Arab-affairs expert, observed in January 1948 that, the majority of the Palestinian masses accept the partition as a fait accompli and do not believe it possible to overcome or reject it.” Three months later, Ben-Gurion similarly reported that, “it is now clear, without the slightest doubt, that were we to face the Palestinians alone, everything would be all right. They, the decisive majority of them, do not want to fight us, and all of them together are unable to stand up to us….”*

*Ben-Gurion rebuffed the various efforts of more pragmatic Palestinian Arabs to reach a modus vivendi since it was his “belief … that Zionist expansionism would be better served by leaving the leadership of the Palestinians in the hands of the extremist Mufti than in the hands of a ‘moderate’ opposition. ‘Rely on the Mufti’ became his motto.”*

*Blocked by Zionist policy from officially expressing their opposition to war, the Palestinian Arabs arranged “non-aggression” pacts with their Jewish neighbors. The relatively few who did take up arms did so primarily to defend themselves against feared attacks by the Jews.*

&#x200B;

Remember, it was during this time that the Zionists began the ethnic cleansing. 

The Deir Yassin massacre happened on April 8th.

The Balad al-Shaykh massacre happened on the New Year.

The Sa'sa' Massacre happened on February.

The Ein al-Zeitun massacre happened on May 1st, ending in the complete destruction of the village. 

Jaffa, which had a population of over 120 thousand, was reduced to only 4 thousand due to Zionist terror.

&#x200B;

200,000 thousand Palestinians left before the Arab League invaded. Israel would later create a committee to destroy (what Ben Gurion called the ""cleaning up"" of Palestinian towns) and prevent the return of Palestinian refugees. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**""But what about the Jews from Arab countries""**

How many Jewish villages were razed?

How many Jews were forced on death marches?

&#x200B;

The expulsion of Palestinians from Palestine are Jews from Arab countries aren't equivalent. There were no policy of ethnic cleansing, no policy of deportation, of the destruction of Jewish homes by the state.

1207,10p4try,2023-01-30,Israel_Palestine,What I Learned In the Past 72 Hours,"For those of you logging on today for the first time in a while, allow me to summarize what I have learned over the past 72 hours.

First we had a thread about how [Israel is or is not an apartheid state](https://reddit.com/r/Israel_Palestine/comments/10lw16c/eu_says_its_antisemitic_to_call_israel_an/), in which I was told the instruments of the occupation (the blockade, checkpoints etc.) exist not to keep Israelis safe but to create a system of Jewish domination over Arabs, and this system is in place because Jews hate Arabs and are racist towards them.

Then we had [a thread about a firefight in Jenin](https://reddit.com/r/Israel_Palestine/comments/10m2jso/israel_army_kills_10_palestinians_including/) in which [the entire sub was lied to and told that an IDF unit went into Jenin and shot nine Palestinians for no reason other than election votes.](https://reddit.com/r/Israel_Palestine/comments/10m2jso/israel_army_kills_10_palestinians_including/j60iz1x/) After some users pointed out that seven of those nine Palestinians were Islamic Jihad terrorists planning a terror attack, they were met with a wall of denial and statements that [Israelis always lie so you can't believe anything they say.](https://reddit.com/r/Israel_Palestine/comments/10oa08r/thoughts_on_this/j6epxdl/), preferring instead a narrative that the terrorists were ordinary townsfolk defending their homes. 

Then we had [one of the most horrific murderous attacks on Jews by a Palestinian](https://reddit.com/r/Israel_Palestine/comments/10mtw5h/at_least_5_killed_in_jerusalem_synagogue_shooting/) since the Itamar Massacre, in which almost no Palestine supporters even bothered to show up on the thread, except for one user who spent hours and hours posting hundreds of comments on a Friday night trying to justify the attack. [Palestinians themselves celebrated the attack](https://reddit.com/r/Israel_Palestine/comments/10nc1hi/palestinians_celebrate_jerusalem_synagogue/), and again, no responses from Palestine supporters beyond some whataboutery. 

Lastly we had another attack, [this one a triple war crime,](https://reddit.com/r/Israel_Palestine/comments/10ngymb/two_seriously_hurt_in_2nd_jerusalem_terror/) and again, almost no Palestine supporters showed up to condemn it or say anything other than whataboutery. 

What did I learn from these four threads, all of which conveniently lied up next to each other on the timeline? 

1. Israeli violence and military action, such as the occupation and the IDF raid, are always assumed to be entirely motivated by anti-Arab racism. There is no benefit of the doubt, there is no compromise, there is no alternatives in the minds of Palestine supporters to this belief. Israelis are always racist and everything they do is racist. 
2. Palestine and its supporters do not believe any of the principles they allegedly preach. They do not actually believe in international law. They do not actually believe in human rights. The moment one of their precious Palestinian victims violated those principles, our friendly local supporters were nowhere to be found. The moment international law and human rights could have applied and protected someone other than Palestinians, they were dropped like a hot potato. The only principles they genuinely have are ethnic tribalism and Arab supremacy. 

I no longer have any interest in hearing Palestine supporters speak the language of human rights, international law, or even basic morality after this weekend. /r/Palestine didn't even post a thread about the synagogue shooting because (I suspect) they would have too many people in support of it and could risk a sitewide ban for supporting violence. All of the sympathy and understanding Palestine supporters had for Islamic Jihad terrorists could not be extended even a little bit to Jewish civilians, and thus I have no sympathy and understanding left for them.

[Bassem Eid, a Palestinian:](https://forward.com/opinion/533947/east-jerusalem-synagogue-jenin-palestinians-violence/)

>There is something deeply broken in a Palestinian street culture that honors violence against innocents, a culture in which some were filmed dancing in the streets and handing out candies after the 9/11 terror attacks. It is this: Multiple generations of Palestinian young people have been taught to hate Jews and Israel’s allies, and to equate attacks on civilians to attacks on military targets.

>Too much of the Western world has coddled this perverse cycle. Enough is enough. Palestinians and all those who truly support us must stand for humanity.

>All humanity should recognize the difference between a preventative assault on a terrorist cell and the massacre of civilians in a house of worship. Yet Palestinian culture has somehow come to tolerate such chilling slaughter. It happened in 1972, after the murder of Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympics, and in 1976, with the plane hijacking to Entebbe, and so many times since.

Tolerate? More like celebrate, but I digress.

[Hussein Aboubakr Mansour, an Egyptian took to Twitter to make a similar statement:](https://twitter.com/HusseinAboubak/status/1620861599446896640?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet)

>Underneath the positions of pro-Palestinian progressive Westerners lies a conglomerate of presuppositions and assumptions that are rarely openly discussed or mentioned. One of such major presuppositions is that Palestinian terrorism, the indiscriminate murderous violence targeting mostly defenseless Jewish civilians, is a core part of the Palestinian identity and a normative Palestinian behavior to be expected. As such, this behavior can not be blamed on Palestinian society or institutions but on Israel and Israeli action, which controls the structure of power from which the Palestinian identity emerged. In this position, highly intelligent people discover the most troubling aspect of the conflict but only to dismiss it.

>This form of humanistic bigotry against the Palestinians came to justify their worst inclination and disregard the lives of Israeli Jews, ending up being one of the most dehumanizing positions towards Israelis and Palestinians. This position is not new but has become a core intellectual habit of the international left since the canonization of the works of Frantz Fanon as a Bible of decolonization. According to Fanon, the murderous rampage of the colonized man against the colonizer is the quintessential act of self-liberation. The blaze of wrath and anger that ends in murder is nothing but the birth pains of freedom. In other words, the struggle, no matter how violent or extreme, is an existential condition and an ontological urgency.

Peter Beinart, long time defender of Palestine and anti-Zionist, [posted on his Substack](https://peterbeinart.substack.com/p/jewish-solidarity-palestinian-freedom) that while intellectually he understands why the massacre occurred, in his heart he feels that his people and his family have been attacked and wounded, which of course they have been.

this sentiment has endured for 70 years and this refusal to compromise after each proposal was arguably the fatal error of palestinian leadership before the un committees. what was the reason for the ideological opposition of a jewish state within palestine, even if it were a tiny fraction of the land?\*

1215,z0hhj3,2022-11-20,Israel_Palestine,Psychology and Israel/Palestine,"Rather than create another thread about the most recent miserable news from Israel/Palestine, I thought I'd discuss a neglected, but important, dynamic - the psychological aspect. Specifically, I'd like to focus my commentary on some of the perceptual tendencies I see from people invested in this subject. 

Confirmation bias - This describes the tendency to search for information that confirms one's preconceptions. It's typical of partisan/dogmatists, which means it's something you'll often (always?) encounter within this subject. So, what can be done?

One technique we can use is to challenge ourself. Think about why our judgements might be wrong. Consider information that might make you uncomfortable. 

Availability Heuristic - Making a judgement about something based on what comes to mind quickly. If you're saturated with news about the conflict, this will likely determine your impressions of Palestinians or Israeli Jews. That is, your idea of who either of these people are will be a (likely toxic) caricature of who they really are. 

Fundamental Attribution Bias - The tendency to attribute behaviour to disposition, and neglect environmental factors. I see this quite often around the discussion of terrorism. Palestinian's militancy is described as cultural in origin, even primordial. Revolving around an antisemitism that developed seemingly in a vacuum. The behaviour that might result from living under a brutal military occupation or blockade is never really considered. 

Why do we do this? 

The Actor-Observer difference - This is the idea that when we observes others the situation becomes invisible, but when we act it's due to the environment. 

In group bias - self explanatory and powerful.

Well, of course this disregards a long history of a unique Arab culture, with even lots of local subdivision in the area of Israel/Palestine. But also people don’t seem to understand that nationalism is a pretty young development in general. It also doesn’t really matter because obviously now a Palestinian identity and Nation exists so you can’t really deny it. 

So, okay let’s say Palestinians are a new Invention but so are Israelis!

As a Jew that came to Israel/Palestine 5 years ago I quickly released that the jewish identity in this country is very different from the one I know. Of course I believe that there is such a thing as the Jewish people but everything that constitutes us as people developed in the diaspora. Jews all around the world where influenced by the countries they lived in but often times due to marginalisation they created their own separate culture that existed within those countries. All of these developed outside of Israel. When Israel was founded the Zionists wanted to create a new Jewish identity. European Jews denied their own past and outlawed to teach Yiddish for instance. Jews from Arab countries were told not to speak “the enemies” languages -Arabic, which was their nativ language at this time. 
You weren’t an Austrian, polish or Algerian Jew anymore now everyone would become Israeli. This new type of Judaism promoted the idea of the “new Jew” the “fighting Jew” one that wouldn’t be marginalised anymore. This is what Zionism had created, a culture based on militarism and now 75 years later we see the logical consequence of such a narrative.

Second, no matter your opinion, it has a much more organized and deliberate approach towards its problems.

Palestinians, in contrast, don't seem to have even discussed their options and situation. The PA clings to Olso despite it being increasingly irrelevant, they have become disliked by Israelis and Palestinian alike for subcontracting the occupation and satisfying neither. Hamas cheers on ""armed resistance"" from literal mental patients while concentrating in reality on attacking Gazans who might criticize them. Israeli Palestinians lack national rights to organize politically. The Palestinian diaspora has embraced a more human rights focused argument, but don't have the political maturity of organizations like AIPAC and that argument doesn't necessarily resonate at home.

So basically, what's the deal? There has been no Palestinian reaction to the unprecedented upheaval in Israel. But people have thoughts and people talk... or at least they should.

I realized this same transition took place for Palestine and its supporters, so I wrote the below piece paraphrasing the Atlantic article and adapting it. Enjoy!*

The Museum of African-American History and Culture is in part a catalog of cruelty. Amid all the stories of perseverance, tragedy, and unlikely triumph are the artifacts of inhumanity and barbarism: the child-size slave shackles, the bright red robes of the wizards of the Ku Klux Klan, the recordings of civil-rights protesters being brutalized by police.

The artifacts that persist in my memory, the way a bright flash does when you close your eyes, are the photographs of lynchings. But it’s not the burned, mutilated bodies that stick with me. It’s the faces of the white men in the crowd. There’s the photo of the lynching of Thomas Shipp and Abram Smith in Indiana in 1930, in which a white man can be seen grinning at the camera as he tenderly holds the hand of his wife or girlfriend. There’s the undated photo from Duluth, Minnesota, in which grinning white men stand next to the mutilated, half-naked bodies of two men lashed to a post in the street—one of the white men is straining to get into the picture, his smile cutting from ear to ear. There’s the photo of a crowd of white men huddled behind the smoldering corpse of a man burned to death; one of them is wearing a smart suit, a fedora hat, and a bright smile.

Their names have mostly been lost to time. But these grinning men were someone’s brother, son, husband, father. They were human beings, people who took immense pleasure in the utter cruelty of torturing others to death—and were so proud of doing so that they posed for photographs with their handiwork, jostling to ensure they caught the eye of the lens, so that the world would know they’d been there. Their cruelty made them feel good, it made them feel proud, it made them feel happy. And it made them feel closer to one another.
This cruelty is present in other locations too, including one that we all know and are familiar with: [Palestine](https://img.haarets.co.il/bs/0000017f-e56a-d97e-a37f-f76f36520000/72/39/71330a977c8cc3928bacf20549b1/2882452659.jpg?precrop=2194,1275,x0,y335&height=630&width=1200&watermark=hdc-2021)

The pro-Palestinian movement is such a whirlwind of cruelty that it can be hard to keep track. Any actual interest in “human rights” or the best interests of the Palestinians was abandoned a long time ago in favor of hate, cruelty, and harassment. In the last six months alone, this one small subreddit has covered so many examples of pro-Palestinians harassing Jews and Israelis and beyond, from [an author who merely wanted to visit Israel](https://www.jpost.com/bds-threat/article-720758) to [Berkeley students banning “Zionists.”](https://www.chronicle.com/article/yes-berkeley-is-discriminating-against-jews) Even [Holocaust survivors](https://www.jpost.com/diaspora/antisemitism/article-717340/) [Orthodox Jews](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZCa2qdyHNk) and [innocent Jewish shoppers](https://twitter.com/MelissaLantsman/status/1542924614296289280) weren’t spared the sneers and jeers of those who call themselves “pro-Palestine.” Most recently, we discussed how [the NUS in the UK is full of examples of cruelty toward Jews at the hands of pro-Palestinians.](https://www.thejc.com/news/news/nus-inquiry-brands-student-union-hostile-environment-for-jews-10g0G1VtbfW7tFpFPxxfGm)

In the infamous anti-Semitic subreddit /r/PublicFreakout, [tens of thousands of people took great joy in mocking](https://np.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/kx6uxt/audience_member_tries_to_paint_dr_norman/) a young female student rightfully offended to the point of tears by Norman Finkelsteins’ insistence on comparing Israeli Jews to Nazis. The clip is from 2003 but gets reposted on Reddit every few years so that Israel haters can engage in a circlejerking orgy of hatred for one of their favorite targets. The student was brought to tears by Finkelsteins’ hateful rhetoric, but the Redditors had nothing but contempt:

“sick burn on the little grief addict in the audience.”

“It's disingenuous, but fundamentalists of every religion have learned that fake outrage and sadness is how you get what you want, especially when you can use six million dead bodies as a cudgel to argue for killing more innocent people.”

“Why tf is she having a nervous breakdown lol truth hurt that much.”

I could go on, but you get the point. Even those who believe that this girl was “faking it,” or was overreacting would see that in any other context for any other minority group that the mocking of her pain renders all minorities on campus collateral damage…maybe. Anyone afraid of speaking out, afraid that she would not be taken seriously, can now look to these pro-Palestinians to see her fears realized. Once malice is embraced as a virtue, it is impossible to contain.

The [cruelty of the actual Palestinian administration’s policies](https://mako.co.il/pride-news/local/Article-0af1b43124ca381026.htm), and the ritual rhetorical flaying of their targets before their supporters, are intimately connected. As Lili Loofbourow wrote of the Brett Kavanaugh incident in Slate, adolescent male cruelty toward women is a bonding mechanism, a vehicle for intimacy through contempt. The white men and the Palestinian men in the lynching photos are smiling not merely because of what they have done, but because they have done it together.

We can hear the spectacle of cruel laughter throughout the pro-Palestine movement. [One of the most iconic images of Palestine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_Ramallah_lynching) is a young man raising his bloody hands with a huge smile on his face, having completed the act of lynching a middle aged Israeli man. There were those who accused Palestine’s victims of being [mentally deficient](https://i.redd.it/0847fx227f491.png) merely for speaking out, not merely in cartoons but in [high production music videos too.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyXD_Kq3q4U) [They take great joy](https://old.reddit.com/r/Israel_Palestine/comments/z91qnn/cinema_viewing_recommendation_for_pro_israel/) in Israelis not wanting to be demonized in a Netflix movie that makes no claims to be a true story and yet is taken as gospel truth by pro-Palestinians anyway. 

And at every pro-Palestine rally, even as the rhetoric gets more [hateful and violent](https://www.foxnews.com/story/protester-calls-for-jews-to-go-back-to-the-oven-at-anti-israel-demonstration), the people chanting it just gets happier and happier.

The author Philip C. Winslow has an [anecdote that sums it up:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victory_for_Us_Is_to_See_You_Suffer)

>Ami Ayalon, a peace campaigner and member of the Knesset, was asked if he stood by his oft-quoted remark that the Palestinians and the Israelis hate each other. ""I cannot say that I hate Palestinians, but I think, as a nation, as a society, yes, most Israelis hate Palestinians and most Palestinians hate Israelis... I had a very interesting meeting in London during the intifada. A Palestinian friend approached me [and said]: 'Ami, we won. We Palestinians won.'... I asked him, 'Are you crazy? What do you mean ""We won""? You are losing so many people... and we are losing so many people. What is the whole essence of victory?' He said, 'Ami you don't understand us. **Victory for us is to see you suffer. This is all we want.** 

It isn’t just the Palestinians who feel that way, their supporters do too. Maybe this is their way of dealing with the fact that they won’t be able to destroy Israel, they’re settling for making their ‘enemies’ suffer. Taking joy in that suffering is more human than most would like to admit. Somewhere on the wide spectrum between adolescent teasing and the smiling Palestinian men in the lynching photographs are the pro-Palestinians whose community is built by rejoicing in the anguish of those they see as unlike them, who have found in their shared cruelty an answer to the loneliness and atomization of modern life.

The laughter undergirds the daily spectacle of insincerity, as the Palestinians and their apologists claim fealty to bedrock democratic, liberal principles they never had intention of respecting. The people who claim Israel floods Gaza with fictional dams and is releasing wild boars to kill Palestinians decry “false accusations” when SJP is reported to have created Jew-free zones in Berkeley; when student activists who fancy themselves victims of a ""Palestinian exception to free speech"" meet references to Jews whose only crimes was coming forward to offer their own stories of abuse with screams of “this is your brain on Zionism!” The political movement that bolsters a country which massacres civilians without a second thought, who encourages children to become martyrs for the cause, and who has murdered innocent people including families now laments Israel's inability to perfectly respect human rights.

This isn’t incoherent. It reflects a clear principle: Only the Palestinians and their allies, their  supporters, and their anointed are entitled to the rights and protections of the law and basic human decency, and if necessary, immunity from it. The rest of us are entitled only to cruelty, by their whim. This is how the powerful have ever kept the powerless divided and in their place, and enriched themselves in the process.

We discussed earlier this year how [Palestinian leaders live in luxury while their people suffer in poverty.](https://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/18763/gaza-suicide-hamas#.Yuo-Vm_7hnk.twitter) The stories are not unconnected. The Palestinian leadership have sought to enrich themselves at the world’s expense; they have attempted to corrupt the international legal system to protect themselves and their cohorts, and they have exploited the left’s darkest impulses in the pursuit of power. But their ability to get away with this fraud is tied to cruelty.

Palestine’s leaders’ only true skill is the con; their only fundamental belief is that the Middle East is the birthright of Muslim Arab men, and their only real, authentic pleasure is in cruelty. It is that cruelty, and the delight it brings them, that binds their most ardent supporters to Palestine, in shared scorn for those they hate and fear: immigrants, “Zionists,” Jews, “normalizers,” and treasonous Arabs who empathize with any of those who would steal their birthright. Palestine’s ability to execute that cruelty through word and deed makes them euphoric. It makes them feel good, it makes them feel proud, it makes them feel happy, it makes them feel united. And as long as Palestine makes them feel that way, they will let Palestine get away with anything, no matter what it costs them.",FederalFriend576,t2_mcu7fvjk,0.58,10,102

Defense of Children International Palestine (DCI Palestine) documented 4 cases of IDF killing children in the recent Jenin incursion, at least one not involved military activity, nor even armed at the time and another killed by an airstrike, so posing no threat to those soldiers who killed him: see [https://www.dci-palestine.org/four\_palestinian\_children\_killed\_in\_israeli\_military\_offensive\_on\_jenin](https://www.dci-palestine.org/four_palestinian_children_killed_in_israeli_military_offensive_on_jenin).  The other 2 cases are still under investigation.

Regarding the militant group's recruitment of minors, DCI Palestine documents some recruitment by Hamas & all, however judging by this 2012 report, the biggest recruiter of Palestinian minors into military activity in the occupied territories is the IDF itself: [https://www.dci-palestine.org/recruitment\_and\_use\_of\_palestinian\_children\_in\_armed\_conflict](https://www.dci-palestine.org/recruitment_and_use_of_palestinian_children_in_armed_conflict).  At least, as of 2012 it was.  DCI Palestine has documented a number of attempts by the IDF to recruit Palestinian kids to become military informants since then with coercion or threats, using them for human shields and the like.

Besides that, Palestinian kids are too commonly subject to arbitrary detainment, torture & degrading treatment, being questioned without parents or lawyers present, see [https://www.dci-palestine.org/arbitrary\_by\_default](https://www.dci-palestine.org/arbitrary_by_default).

If children in Palestine are growing up under these conditions, it seems to me inexcusable.  The accusations by zionists against the militant groups, even if there's some truth in them, are just hand waving, trying to get everyone else to avoid examining the real issue.  Israel has imposed these conditions on Palestinian children.",lynmc5,t2_kfvd4o8r,0.69,13,65

The response I found to be the most informative was from a Palestinian-Israeli political science professor at the University of Haifa. He offered a very sharp critique of the Palestinian leadership. I'll try and summarize:

Palestinians have enabled their sorry situation. Since 1948 their leadership has failed to formulate a coherent, shared vision, that's palatable to Israeli Jews (and the greater world). Unlike the early Zionists, or the neighbouring Arab countries, they've been unable to rally their population around a clear goal. 

Instead, you have four different communities with disparate objectives. The Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza, want an independent country in those territories. Their leadership - Hamas and PA - has done little more than help maintain the status quo.  Israeli Palestinians want equality within Israel. And the Palestinians in refugee camps are preoccupied with returning to their ancestral homes.",mikeffd,t2_mat1k,0.84,11,40

According to Thomas Friedman's new column, the fragile, partial peace in Israel-Palestine is increasingly strained by ""the fading of the peace process and prospects of a two-state solution, the expansion of Jewish settlements in the West Bank, the corruption and breakdown of the Palestinian Authority,"" and the election of an ultra-right-wing Israeli government.   

&#x200B;

He also describes a phenomenon similar to what drove American social reactions to police brutality.  Cell phone cameras make more and more incidents of ""a Palestinian shot by Israeli soldiers or Israelis rammed into or attacked with knives by individual Palestinians"" into instant social media sensations.   

&#x200B;

Middle-class Arab Israeli citizens are increasingly integrated into mainstream Israeli spaces, Israeli suburban communities, Israeli companies, Israeli universities.  But there is a conservative populist right-wing Israeli reaction to living in a more diverse and cosmopolitan society, similar to the anxieties that have driven right-wing populism in the United States and Hungary; in its most chauvinistic form, for example, resenting seeing Arabic spoken in a local pharmacy or public square.

The assumption goes that if Israel absorbs the West Bank and Gaza Strip, it can be voted out of existence by an Arab majority.

However, the Israeli Jewish fertility rate has been rising while the Arab fertility rate in both Israel and the territories is on the decline. Not to mention that the immigration balance is vastly in favor of Jews. If this goes on then in the future a one-state solution will be possible where Israel remains a Jewish state as is now. I don't think merging the two populations would be a good or stable solution, but it might be able to work. In any case that's the only kind of one-state solution the Israeli Jewish public would even entertain. 

So my question is, would advocates of the one-state solution still be as supportive of it if it didn't mean an Arab Palestine replacing Israel?

1235,17oqbu2,2023-11-06,Israel_Palestine,How UNRWA repeatedly changed the definition of refugee to accommodate Palestinians,"Destiny briefly mentioned during his stream on Saturday that he couldn't find evidence of that. Here's a [summary](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/08/17/unrwa-has-changed-the-definition-of-refugee/) from the Foreign Policy magazine ([non-paywalled link](https://archive.ph/CLH8w)).

> UNRWA was founded in 1949 through U.N. General Assembly Resolution 302 at the conclusion of the Arab-Israeli conflict of 1948 

> The agency defines Palestinian refugees as “persons whose normal place of residence was Palestine during the period 1 June 1946 to 15 May 1948, and who lost both home and means of livelihood as a result of the 1948 conflict.”

> In 1965, UNRWA changed the eligibility requirements to be a Palestinian refugee to include third-generation descendants, and in 1982, it extended it again, to include all descendants of Palestine refugee males, including legally adopted children, regardless of whether they had been granted citizenship elsewhere. This classification process is inconsistent with how all other refugees in the world are classified, including the definition used by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the laws concerning refugees in the United States.

> The only refugees who do not fall under the UNHCR and instead have their own agency are the Palestinians. While the UNHCR has resettled millions of refugees, since the time it was created, UNRWA has not managed to solve or even diminish the problem at all. Instead, using its own metrics, the number of refugees has grown exponentially, while UNRWA has become one of the larger U.N. agencies, with 30,000 personnel and a $1.2 billion budget. This is despite the fact that many of the UNRWA “refugees” are not actually refugees at all under the standard international definition of that term. For example, of the 2 million Palestinian refugees in Jordan, most have been granted Jordanian citizenship.

By contrast, all of 850K Mizrahi Jewish refugees, expelled from the Arab states, have since been integrated in Israel or elsewhere. Overall, over 50M people got displaced during the formation of modern states in the last 75 years. This includes 20M people moved between Pakistan/India in 1947, or 15M Sudeten Germans, or the 1.5M people displaced during the Armenian-Azeri wars. They have all largely settled in their new countries of residence, and none of them have the right of return.

Here's what Alexander Galloway, then the director of UNRWA in Jordan, had to say about Palestinian refugees in 1952:

> It is perfectly clear that Arab nations do not want to solve the Arab refugee problem. They want to keep it as an open sore, as an affront against the United Nations and as a weapon against Israel. Arab leaders don’t give a damn whether the refugees live or die.

And it seems to be indeed the case. For instance, the Arab League passed the Resolution 1547 in 1959, explicitly instructing its members not to give Palestinians citizenship, in order to “avoid dissolution of their identity and protect their rights to return to their homeland”. So although many Palestinians have lived there for centuries, they are denied integration in order to put additional pressure on Israel. The only country that has naturalised a significant number of Palestinians is Jordan, the majority of whose population is currently Palestinian. However, even Jordan revoked its citizenship from all Palestinians residing in the West Bank in 1990-2010.

If UNRWA understood the cause as early as 1952, why hasn't it done anything to actually solve the problem, instead of indefinitely perpetuating it, at a bloating expense to U.N. funders, such as the USA?",OmOshIroIdEs,t2_4yj0q2gd,0.59,9,33

1237,175wvyl,2023-10-12,Israel_Palestine,Seeking to learn: Can zionism be classified as settler colonial?,"Given.... recent events, I decided to do some learning about the history of the conflict. 

I'm a random white american, so I got no real background or familial involvement here.


I also wanna say from the start I fully denounce any attacks or targeting of civilian populations. Done by Hamas or the Israeli government. Killing concert-goers is wrong. So is bombing apartments. Killing civilians is bad.

I am aware this is a very sensitive subject right now. So I will try and be as sensitive as I can be. If you would like me to take down the post as an acknowledgement of .... events, I will be happy to do so. Just lmk. I don't want to be tone deaf or anything.

With that out of the way, my question:

I've heard a number of different arguments from pro and anti zionism?

I'll also preface this with my (admittedly basic) understanding of zionism:
Basically, if you look at the history of jewish people, they kept getting killed or pogromed. wherever they go. Everyone always seems to scapegoat and murder them. And not wanting to get murdered is a fairly sympathetic goal. The reason they could always be scapegoated is because they were always a minority. So if they were the majority, then they would be able go ensure no anti-semitic violence would be done (on a large scale at least). Hence the idea for a jewish state. There were several initial locations discussed, including Uganda and Argentina, but the Levant was the ultimate choice.

Pro:

-Jews are indigenous to Israel. Many were expelled by imperial powers and forced abroad. Some stayed in the region continuously for hundreds of years. There are many artifacts and archeological sites that show jewish habitation for centuries back. Therefore Israel represents DECOLONIZATION rather than colonization

-Many current Israelis aren't even from Europe, they're from surrounding African and Asian countries after major expulsions due to anti-semitic violence. Not only that but many of the European settlers were also fleeing anti-semitic violence in Europe. Can a refugee really count as a settler colonialist?

-The initial settlements were bought legally and therefore ought to belong to the purchasers.

-Palestinian nationalism emerged in the 60s and has no real roots before the establishment of Israel. Before that they were just thought of as Arab and wanted to be a part of a larger Arab state

Anti:

-It's true there's been a continuous jewish presence in Palestine. However, these jews spoke completely different languages then the ones who started showing up in the early 20th century. They were also a minority of the population. There was very little overlap between the jews that started arriving and those that were already there. In fact the PLO classified the jews that were already there as part of the Palestinian national identity (according to wikipedia anyways). If anyone could claim indignity it would be these jewish folks and the Palestinain population they were a part of, rather than the folks who started showing up in the early 20th century.

-The 1948 plan was vastly disproportionate to the relative populations and quality of land. Furthermore in the 1948 war, operation dalet led to the forced removal of many palestians from their homes as was explicitly spelled out. Plus there were a variety or atrocities committed in an attempt to force Palestinians out.

-Ben Gurion, Herzl amd many other early Zionists explicitly used the terms ""colonial"" and ""colonists"" and how the ""arab population must be forced out"". In fact, herzl wrote to Cecil Rhodes seeking his advice about colonization for this purpose.

-It is ridiculous to claim that a jewish person in New York has a greater claim of indigenity to land thousands of miles away than someone whose family and them have lived on it for generations. Yes, Palestinian jews may claim indigenity but not Jewish folks from New York or Chicago or LA.

-The initial zionist plans involved discussions of colonization of Argentina and Uganda. Lands that have literally 0 connection to jewish history. If zionism isn't settler colonial in nature why were Uganda and Argentina discussed in the first place? Why does moving the location change the fundamental nature of the project?


Mixed:

-Land claims are complex. While it is true Arabs arrived in the region later, families have lived there for generations by this point. Hundred and hundreds of years. If jewish folks in london have a claim to it, surely folks whose families have been there for generations do as well. 



Tbh I am not even sure how useful this discussion is to have as I don't think that either the Israeli or palestinain population is gonna up and leave anytime soon. Any peace deal is gonna have to figure out how to share land. I'm not sure how or the right answer here but I don't believe they'll be some Maas exodus of one population.

1241,14boobb,2023-06-17,Israel_Palestine,"In light of reddit's corporate moves, maybe let's have some real talk about the quality of discussion possible","So I made [this comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/14ag85h/reddit_threatens_to_remove_moderators_from/joaowzz/) a few days ago, been thinking about ditching reddit due to well, the way it is. Maybe it's worthwhile to talk about that, and this.

First issue is we know the Israel-Palestine conflict is contentious and drives its own media industry in a way something like the intrastate violence in Tigray doesn't. People want to to know what exactly is happening, and why. So I don't think this attention is antisemitism. WW2 and the Shoah are things I learned about as a child in school. My mom took me to see Schindler's List as a teen and it's haunting and impactful. Jewish people are a landmark in western culture that's impossible to miss -- Mel Brooks, Einstein, Hannah Arendt, Elie Wiesel, bagels, the Hanukkah song, our classmates, neighbors and friends. The Jewish diaspora, especially in North America, in simply part of our life and it's been that way since mass immigration in 19th century. The Palestinian diaspora is growing but naturally they haven't had the same time to establish themselves. And as Israel claims to be a 'Jewish state', with a violent founding, violent headlines and still politically contentious in our own time, it does provoke curiosity about what that is, exactly.

So given the attention-grabbing nature of the conflict, it engenders motivation to control the narrative, often by hateful and prejudiced contributors. Reddit is poorly equipped to deal with this. Moderation is an unpaid job and demanding. We saw that with a sub takeover recently -- the individual was aggravated by antisemitic commentary, but of course the hate goes the other way just as often. That's without the wealth of bad history, misrepresentation, hot takes/rage bait and one-sided discourse. Trying to prevent discussion from devolving into bias and backbiting is a full-time job and all we know it's not paid.

I have learned a lot about the history and context of the conflict -- from more credible media. User discussions are put frankly, terrible. They are dominated more by racism and bigotry than any desire to understand and educate, must less reconcile. JeffB said ""unfiltered"" discussion was important to represent the reality but from what I see, it's more of an opportunity to excuse borderline hate speech -- which is the norm, not the exception. So is dishonest characterization. Social media can incubate radicalism and that's what it feels like here. Dissenting voices are not empowered to stop this.

So maybe it's time to admit that social media was a failure to create civil discussion and understanding. I don't think there's much value in this anymore, if there ever was. What do you guys think?

1243,17nzcl3,2023-11-05,Israel_Palestine,Not one state nor two states solutions would work,"
I think that both the two-state and one-state solutions don't quite fit the Israel-Palestine situation.

**Two-state Solution Issues:**
1. about 150,000 messianic settlers probably won't leave easily. This could mean them clashing with the IDF, leading to a civilian war between settlers and idf leading to a broader civilian war inside Israel. Israel wouldn’t want that. 

2. Palestinians might not take the land offers as they didn't take in the past.

3. On the Day of Independence, there might be an even bigger war between Israel and Palestine.

4. Israel is worried about the West Bank because of what happened in Gaza after they left, and then Hamas took over.

5. The land is all mixed up, especially in places like Jerusalem. Splitting that up sounds really tricky and causing more damage.

6. Dividing stuff like water and farmland would be a big problem too.

7. Israel would be worried about security and safety if the land got split.

8. Both sides have have economic relations, splitting might mean ending that, which will lead to more poverty in the short term

9. There are loads of religious places all over. Who's gonna decide who gets what?

**One-state Solution Issues:**

1. A lot of Palestinians probably wouldn't want an Israeli passport or to be called Israeli citizens.

2. If they all lived in one country, there might be even bigger fights.

3. It feels risky having extremists with really strong opinions living next to each other and trying to share one government.

4. Making sure everyone gets a fair say in one shared government? That's another problem.

5. They've each got their own rules and laws. How would you even start combining all of that?

7. There's also the thing about money. Some places are richer, and some are poorer. Balancing that as a government would be hard.

8. And then there's the question of who'll be the majority in the future. That could shake things up a lot.

Thinking about all these problems, maybe a one country-two states solution makes more sense. Imagine a country called ""Israel-Palestine"" that's got one main government but two separate states inside. Here's what I'm thinking:

1. Israeli settlers stay Israeli but live by Palestinian rules. Palestinians can live in Israel and go by Israeli rules.

2. A peacekeeping force with soldiers and commanders from each side with the aim to create a non conflict atmosphere 

3. Israel and Palestine each do their own thing – like with taxes or languages. But the big government above them makes sure everyone's treated right and equal.

4. The main government will have people from every minority in the country. They'd work on getting everyone on the same page and keeping the governments democratic – with economic agreements , teaching Hebrew and Arabic, having talks, and making sure everyone's basic rights are protected.



(Must admit I used ChatGPT to improve my English when writing this, as I’m not a native English speaker)

Also,
The one country two states solution is kind of based on what “a land for all” proposes



Edit: I just want to add that it is so upsetting that we (me as Israeli and people in this region) were born to this stubbornness; the two most stubborn nations in the world; these extremists and governments are not even trying to find the middle anymore, no side wants to give up on nothing, it’s like they both truly believe that “the other side has to leave” or die.. meanwhile there are big groups of people who just want peace and to live side by side..
I feel like until new leaders will appear and start shouting new messages nothing of the above is possible… and people of both sides don’t like ‘new ideas’…

1244,14u6b8p,2023-07-08,Israel_Palestine,Ukraine and Palestine,"Making a comparison between the Israeli/Palestinian conflict and the Russian invasion of Ukraine might feel like a stretch, but I see it as a useful exercise.

Like Revisionist Zionists and the West Bank/Palestinians, Vladimir Putin considers Ukraine/Ukrainians as an invention, populated by illegitimate nationalities. 

Similarly, both Putin and the current Israeli administrations have used security as pretext for military action. For the Russians, it's been the spectre of NATO expansion (note: I recognize this is contentious). For the Israelis, it's been retaliation (or anticipatory self-defense), against militancy/terrorism. 

But what about Palestinian intransigence? Haven't they turning down multiple offers for peace? Besides, the Ukrainians never attacked against civilians inside Russia like the Palestinians routinely do. 

That's at least partially true. But the Israelis were never keen on creating a Palestinian state. Take a look at where Golda Meir, Menachem Begin, Yitzhak Shamir, Netanyahu, or Ariel Sharon have said about the creation of a Palestinian state. Moreover, read up on settlement activity that occurred over their time. Not exactly the activity of a govt that wants to cede the territory. If anyone's interested in this subject to read Seth Anziska's excellent Preventing Palestine. 

Why bother with this clumsy comparison? Well, the American State Dept and much of the foreign policy elite have condemned Russia, while simultaneously defending what Israel does. Doesn't speak to the arbitrary nature we're viewing this conflict? What's the difference between the Ukrainians we're lionizing for defending Kiev, and the Palestinian terrorists that were just taken out in Jenin? Who determines when attacking a sovereign country is justified?

1246,114aqdv,2023-02-17,Israel_Palestine,Bargaining Strategies in Interstate Relations,"Hey there, everybody.

I was recently reading an article about Ronald Reagan and the end of the Cold War in which I found a section that seemed generally relevant to most if not all international conflicts, including Israel and Palestine of course.

[Click here to download a PDF of the full article](https://www.hsdl.org/?view&did=444565). The section of interest is titled ""The End of the Cold War in Light of Research on Bargaining Strategies."" I will copy and paste most of it below, editing out as much as I reasonably can that is specific to the USA/USSR/Cold War (emphasis my own).

&#x200B;

>Findings on the typical effectiveness of the strategies states have historically employed against potential adversaries are the most pertinent. This research suggests that ***a purely hard-line strategy aimed at forcing the other state out of existence is unlikely to be successful***. Perhaps the most relevant research concerns coercive diplomacy. Coercive diplomacy is a strategy that employs threats, especially military threats, to pressure a target state to change its behavior. Research on cases where states have attempted coercive diplomacy finds that the strategy fails much more often than it succeeds.\[11\]   
>  
>***Coercion is especially unlikely to succeed when the other side would threaten its survival by giving in to the demands placed on it***. The logic here is similar to situations of deterrence. In contrast to coercive diplomacy, which seeks to stop or change a course of action already underway, deterrence seeks to prevent an action from being initiated by threatening to impose costs on the target state if it takes that action. In many cases, the most powerful threat the deterrer can issue is the threat to eliminate the ruling regime in the other state. For this deterrent threat to work, the target state must have assurance that, as long as it does not take the action being deterred, it will not suffer the threatened punishment.\[12\] If the deterrer announces plans to try to change the regime in the other state whether or not it acts aggressively, then the other side has no incentive to be deterred. Without the assurance that the regime will be permitted to survive if it behaves itself, the target state might as well take a chance on obtaining the benefits of aggression. For the same reason, an expressed intent of forcing the other side's collapse undermines the chances that coercive diplomacy will lead to behavior modification. Without an assurance that a change in behavior will result in the lifting of the coercive pressure, why would any state give in?   
>  
>In contrast, coercive diplomacy is more likely to succeed when it is accompanied by positive incentives.\[13\] The net benefits of changing its behavior are made greater if, in addition to the lifting of coercive pressure, the target state can also obtain new, positive rewards. This also provides a degree of face saving for the other side, which can claim it accepted a bargain and did not simply cave in to outside pressure. Coercion is most likely to be effective, therefore, if it seeks to change the other side's behavior without seeking to cause the other side's collapse and it includes the promise of positive benefits if the other side becomes more cooperative. This is very different from the portrait that is often painted of the Reagan approach, and it raises doubt about whether his policies would have worked had they been purely coercive and tied to an unwavering objective of destroying the Soviet Union.   
>  
>Research on crisis bargaining leads to the same conclusion. Several studies have examined the different bargaining strategies states have used across a large number of crises and compared the outcomes. In general, strategies can be characterized as primarily coercive (or ""bullying""), primarily conciliatory, or a relatively balanced mix of carrots and sticks. This last approach has been labeled both a ""firm but fair"" strategy and a ""reciprocating"" strategy: it seeks to demonstrate firmness while also signaling a willingness to cooperate if the other side behaves cooperatively. ***Historically, a firm-but-fair strategy has led to successful outcomes much more often than the other two. An overly conciliatory strategy runs the risks usually associated with appeasement by making it appear the other side can get away with pressing harder. An overly coercive strategy, in contrast, tends to convince the other side to dig in its heels and thus is most likely to lead to an escalatory spiral. A strategy that shows a state's resolve to defend itself while also credibly offering to reciprocate cooperation by the other side has the best chance to resolve a crisis peacefully without requiring the state to give up any of its vital interests***.\[14\] Empirical generalizations based on a number of cases and supported by logical reasoning thus imply it is unlikely that the approach often ascribed to Reagan would have produced a peaceful end to the Cold War.   
>  
>This inference is supported by one other conclusion in the research on strategic interaction. The effectiveness of any strategy is also dependent on internal factors in the target state. The same strategy can produce different results depending on domestic political conditions and the character of the leadership on the other side. In particular, a forceful strategy can discredit hard- liners when they are in power in the other state, but if this emphasis on strength is not adjusted after reformers come to power it can also undermine their attempts at moderation.

1248,111csyp,2023-02-13,Israel_Palestine,Dignity,"I've just finished a book about Identity Politics by Francis Fukuyama. His thesis centres around three intrinsic human desires (listed below), and how those have manifested themselves politically. 

* Thymos (from Plato's Republic) - the desire for recognition and dignity
* Isothymia - a desire to be seen as equal. These are two intrinsic aspects of the soul that supersede other interests (ex. economic). 
* Megalothymia - the desire to dominate others. 

What does this have to do with Israel and Palestine? I think if we approach the conflict through the prism of these desires, we might be able to get a better grasp of the dynamics on the ground. 

Currently, the Palestinians and Israelis are locked in an escalating cycle of violence. From what I've read, the recent terrorist attacks have been dismissed as being motivated by little more than hatred. That could be, but what if we take Fukuyama's model? Palestinian terrorism/militancy might be motivated by an intrinsic need for dignity and equality. 

If that's the case, then just doubling down on punitive measures will never be a solution. Israel has decided to address the recent wave of attacks with their old punitive formula: restrictions, accelerated settlement construction, arrests, home demolitions, etc. But that never works, because it doesn't address the problem: relative inequality and indignity suffered by Palestinians. 

The Trump Plan attempted to get around these desires through economic incentives, but it was rejected for the same reasons. We'll never resolve the conflict until these are addressed.",mikeffd,t2_mat1k,0.73,5,53

1257,11xupac,2023-03-21,Israel_Palestine,"if israel was not established in 1948, what are the chances another shoah would have occured?","a foundational theme of political zionism's narrative is that if jewish people did not have a jewish state for themselves then the jewish people are in imminent danger and the horrors of the 30s and 40s will be repeated. this is expressed often in corey gil-shuster's interviews of israelis. in one interview a group of jewish women acknowledged that relations between jewish and non jewish palestinians were cordial before the new yishuv came yet believed that the erosion of that coexistence was *a small price to pay* for the continued existence of the jewish people.

is this propaganda that exploits collective fear and trauma? or is there legitimacy to this claim? must a state exist for jewish people to be protected? if palestine were liberated today would the existence of the jewish people be threatened? 

(to clarify, i make a distinction between a zionism and political zionism, as this is how its been explained to me. zionism is the ancient idea that palestine is the homeland of the jewish people, whereas political zionism is a more recent idea developed in europe which argued that jewish people must have political control over palestine, aka their own state).",sniperandgarfunkel,t2_9464gtbl,0.57,3,359

The current government is a right winged government in which the prime minister is Benjamin Netanyahu which has been the prime minister for over 15 years.

The change in parties taking control has shortened the temper of both political wings and has caused injuries which in some cases were serious. 

The frequent changes in governments have caused political instability which can (and has affected in some cases) its relation to other countries and the west. The change is not drastic, but it can have long lasting effects.

 Political instability can result in social, ethnic or national disintegration and provide a sort of a barrier to progress through repression and negative change. It may also cause foreign intervention or an increase in foreign influence which can either be bad for Israel and in extension Palestine.

1261,17cnncn,2023-10-20,Israel_Palestine,Two-state can never happen now - no good options,"Even before the events of this month, it seems obvious that the two-state dream is just that, a dream. It has never happened and will never happen.

Much of the Israel/Palestine dispute is about security. The blockade of Gaza has been in place since 2007 because, to oversimplify Israel doesn't trust Hamas. Theoretically, if Gaza had a government that was able to prevent terrorism, the blockade could be lifted. Yes I am aware that even last month that was an unlikely occurrence. But it was *theoretically* possible.

But many of the other points of conflict between Israel and Palestine are not resolvable. Not even theoretically.

The closest we ever came to peace was the failed Camp David/Taba negotiations of 2000-01. There were all sorts of reasons for this failure - lack of trust, disagreements over land swaps, roads, etc. But there was one point where the gap between the two sides was too large ever to be settled by negotiation, and that was the right of return.

Since 1948, almost the entire Arab world has been united behind the right of return. All descendants of the 700,000 or so who fled during the Nakhba *have* to be allowed back into Israel. Any other solution is the legitimization of land theft. Surely, if people have had their land stolen from them, their descendants have the right to get it back.

Indeed, the solidity of the Arab position has only led to more suffering for the refugees. Only Jordan has actually given Palestinians citizenship (and even that is not complete). Lebanon for one arguably has a system that is almost as much apartheid as Israel's - Palestinians are left stateless and have severe restrictions on where they can work and live. Even when the Gaza Strip was under Egyptian rule prior to 1967, its residents were not permitted to freely travel to or work in Egypt. Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states generally take Palestinians as temporary migrant workers only. Saudi Arabia does grant citizenship to workers to have been resident there 10 years or more - but makes an exception for Palestinians. All the rich Gulf states import hundreds of thousands of migrant workers from Asia, who send valuable remittances to their home countries, but take only small numbers of Palestinians, even expelling many for their support of Saddam Hussein in the 1991 Gulf war.

All this because to accept Palestinians into other Arab countries would apparently weaken their claim to return to pre-1948 Palestine.

But this strikes at the very heart of the issue. There are 5.5 million Palestininans in the occupied territories, more than 3 million in Jordan, and at least a million more in Lebanon and Syria (or were, prior to many fleeing Syria's civil war). Not all of them necessarily want to move to be Israel, but enough likely do to easily outnumber Israel's Jewish population of 7.1 million.

And, of course, Israel will never permit this. The entire reason for Israel's existence is to have a clearly majority Jewish state. They will accept their own Arab minority, about 20 percent of its population, but at Taba they refused to consider giving more than 100,000 the right of return, even if it were staggered over several years. This is why Israel did not simply annex the territories in 1967, aside from East Jerusalem - and even there, Palestinians were only given residence rights, not voting rights, and even the residence rights have often proven to exist on paper only.

Since Taba, even the offer Ehud Barak made then is no longer possible. Yes, Arafat made a clear mistake in rejecting the deal, but even if he had accepted it, Ariel Sharon's government would almost certainly have abandoned it anyway. Because that offer precluded more settlements. Since then, settlements have only expanded. Indeed, one constant in Israeli policy has been the expansion of settlements.

And this too goes to the heart of the Israeli project. Israel is located in the region because of its biblical significance. That means Jerusalem and historical parts of ancient Israel. To expect Israel to withdraw from the West Bank is to expect them to ignore one of the primary reasons they sought to establish a state in the first place. They simply aren't going to pull 500,000 people out of a territory they have such a deeply felt religious attachment to.

Israel doesn't have the same religious attachment to other areas. They did return the Sinai to Egypt, and tear down the settlements there. They did withdraw from Gaza in 2005, tearing down its settlements too, even if they did continue to blockade it. This was only feasible because only 8,000 settlers lived in Gaza, and a similarly small number in Sinai.

Almost every single peace proposal ever made is based on the land-for-peace formula, and every single one of these has failed. Because settlements. Two different peoples want this land. It is not possible for both of them to have it. It is not even possible for both of them to share it. Not in the numbers of each that we have now.

Settlements and the right of return would remain dealbreakers even if Palestine was entirely ruled by governments that renounced terrorism. Israel simply will not budge on these two issues, and never will. It doesn't matter if Palestinians continue with terrorism, or resort to nonviolent civil disobedience, or even give up entirely and surrender. There is no right of return and no halt to the building of settlements.

Indeed, the failure of Israeli policy in the past 20 years has been to imagine that this chasm can simply be ignored, that Israel can maintain the blockade on Gaza and continue expanding settlements in the West Bank, and face only occasional light casualties, and just ""mow the lawn"" over any opposition. They have even cynically encouraged Hamas to take more power away from Fatah, going so far as to leave the Gaza border understrength so they could send more troops to the West Bank. Because settlements.

Israel can't be dislodged from these positions, and no, a vicious terrorist attack like that of Oct 7 is not helping. But is there really no future for Palestinians other than being blockaded in an open-air prison, or carved up into bantustans?

It is possible that Israel is at this very moment planning to expel a large percentage of the Gaza Strip's population, using the terrorism of Oct 7 as its justification. Surely a voluntary, planned resettlement would have been vastly more humane than this is likely to be.

More than a million Syrians emigrated to Europe during that country's civil war. Many are Sunni refugees fleeing the Shi'a dominated Assad regime. They don't have an effective right of return either; those who have tried have frequently been attacked by militias loyal to the regime, and often ended up displaced or even fleeing again. A similar story for Iraqi refugees from that country's civil war, or Kurds fleeing decades of terror and repression. And Afghans. And Yemenis. And Libyans. And Sudanese. And so on. Truth be told, the right of return is guaranteed in law, but like all international laws it is only as strong as its enforcement. Military force was used to drive refugees out, not let them back in. And I know of no other refugee people for whom the right of return became such an international cause célèbre.

But where would all these people actually *go?* More on that later.",tdpz1974,t2_199s8d7u,0.64,3,14
1262,z7t4od,2022-11-29,Israel_Palestine,Are pro-Palestinians guilty of stochastic terrorism? Of course.,"Last week, there was yet another mass shooting in the United States, this one targeting an LGBTQ nightclub in Colorado. In reaction, many prominent Democrats accused right wing Republicans of something called ""stochastic terrorism."" This term did not originate this week, it also was discussed earlier this month after the attack on Paul Pelosi, which we discussed at the time. More about stochastic terrorism:

>[Stochastic terrorism is a specific type of extremist violence that occurs when an environment has ""othered"" a population or individual to a significant enough extent that results in subsequent violence against them,  Eric K. Ward, senior advisor to the Western States Center, told Insider.](https://www.businessinsider.com/stochastic-terrorism-meaning-definition-form-of-extremist-political-violence-2022-11?op=1)

>No legitimate organization or public figure explicitly enabled the 22-year-old shooter to attack Giffords, nor did any politician directly encourage people to enact violence against Middle Easterners following 9/11, Spaaij explained, but an environment of extremism and polarization paved the way for their actions.

>""These are individual attacks, but actually there are patterns in the sense that if you create a polarized-enough environment with hate speech and conspiracy theories that pits particular groups against each other, that really starts undermining the legitimacy of democratic institutions and people's trust,"" Spaaij told Insider.

In other words, because right wing Americans work so hard **to create an environment** which demonizes LGBTQ+ people, such as calling them things like ""groomers"" and accusing them of wanting to turn your boy into a girl and vice versa, it was only a matter of time until there was violence against LGTBQ+ people at the hands of a right winger, and **such violence is at least partially the fault of those right wingers who created such a hostile environment.**

If this same principle applies to right-wingers, as I believe it should, the same must also apply to that darling of the international left, the pro-Palestinian movement.

**Do pro-Palestinians demonize Jews?** 

Of course. We've covered quite a few examples of this on the subreddit:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel_Palestine/comments/xhte1a/toronto_activist_dressed_as_jew_harasses/

https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel_Palestine/comments/x46f2x/arab_comedian_harasses_orthodox_jews_in_new_york/

https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel_Palestine/comments/vpto53/bds_screaming_free_palestine_yelling_antisemitic/

This is exactly why ""demonizing"" Israel and Zionists is included in the IHRA definition of anti-Semitism, a definition that is fought against so hard by pro-Palestinians specifically because they want to cross the line and do exactly that.

**Do pro-Palestinians call for violence against Jews?**

Of course. A few examples, again from this subreddit alone:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel_Palestine/comments/xk8zw5/propalestine_march_in_the_uk_led_by_philosopher/

https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel_Palestine/comments/wgfjca/squad_member_cori_bush_fundraised_with/

https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel_Palestine/comments/w170c9/propalestinian_protester_called_for_jews_to_go/

And here are some more from the [ADL's database of extremist incidents in 2022 alone](https://www.adl.org/resources/tools-to-track-hate/heat-map), though notice that some of them fall into the demonization category as well:

* January, Brooklyn NY: Graffiti that read, ""Kill Israel and the Jews"" was found on the campus of a middle school.

*  January, Seattle WA: The message ""It's okay to be a Zionist genocider"" was found spray-painted across the Jewish Family Service.

*   February, University City MO: In a social media post, a campus Birthright program was the target of an anti-Zionist campaign comparing them to Patriot Front, a White Supremacist organization. The campaign strongly suggested that, like the Patriot Front, the Birthright program should not be allowed on campus and the post included the call ""Death to all Settler Colonialism!""

*   April, New Brunswick NJ: The Israel Fellow for the University of Rutgers Hillel received multiple antisemitic Instagram comments in response to a video they posted regarding the recent terror attack in Israel. One comment read, ""die jews die.""

*   May, Santa Barbara CA: ""Zionist the evil Jews have got to go"" was written in chalk by a bus stop.

*   May, Champaign IL: ""Death to Israel"" and ""Israelis kill children"" was written in chalk on a college campus.

*  July, Lakewood CO: A Jewish person was approached by an unknown individual on the street who said, ""The Zionists will burn.""

*  August, Miami FL: A Jewish institution received a threatening phone call in which the caller threatened violence against the Jewish community on behalf of his ""Palestinian Wife"" in relation to events in Israel. The caller threatened to cut off the heads of Jewish people.

**Do pro-Palestinians engage in violence against Jews?**

Of course. Just a few relatively recent examples:

[A summary.](https://www.jpost.com/arab-israeli-conflict/article-710931)

Any good faith actor with a Google account can find more if they are willing to search. Of course, these are not mass shootings. The pro-Palestine movement hasn't escalated that far...in the United States. In Europe though:

""On March 11, 2012, a series of terrorist attacks began in and around Toulouse, France, that were the first jihadi attacks on French soil in a decade and a half and ended in one of the worst targeted attacks on Jews in France since the Second World War. The attacks began with the killing of a French-Muslim paratrooper in Toulouse. Four days later, two more French soldiers of North African origin were killed in Montauban, and then before being killed by security forces after a 32-hour siege, **the assailant brutally murdered a rabbi and three children at a Jewish school in Toulouse**..."" 

""But what led to the specific targeting in Merah’s killing spree? “During the siege negotiations, he reportedly told police that **he was acting in revenge for the death of children in Palestine,** out of hatred for the French army’s international missions, and to punish France for banning the Islamic veil,” suggesting that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was a primary driver for him targeting Jews.""

""On May 24, 2014, armed with a pistol and Kalashnikov assault rifle, Nemmouche **attacked the Jewish Museum in central Brussels,** killing two Israeli tourists, a French volunteer, and a Belgian museum receptionist. It was the first attack in Europe by an Islamist fighter returning from the war in Syria. ...  it is this analyst’s assessment that targeting of the Jewish Museum was Nemmouche’s attempt to copycat Merah’s actions in 2012 with the goal of achieving the same notoriety and attention that Merah had received. ""

"" On January 9, 2015, a 32-year-old Frenchman of Malian origin who converted to Islam and had radicalized while in prison in France took over a kosher grocery store, the Hyper Cacher, in Paris, killing four Jewish customers immediately and then taking the remaining shoppers hostage.... By targeting both “media personalities and media centers that are leading the war against the Muslims” and “places where Jews are gathered … avoiding places of worship and synagogues,” the Kouachis and Coulibaly were knowingly or unknowingly following a course of action recommended by al-Suri in the doctrines of the Global Islamic Resistance Call.""

""Just a month after the Paris attacks, on February 14, 2015, Omar El-Hussein, 22, launched targeted attacks against a free-speech event in Copenhagen, killing one, and then that night, shooting and killing a Jewish volunteer guard outside the city’s main synagogue while a bat mitzvah was being celebrated. Several hours later, he was killed in gunfire after injuring five police officers in a shoot-out...**A former classmate of El-Hussein described him as often discussing “the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. [And] he was not afraid to say openly that he hated Jews.**""

[Source](https://ctc.westpoint.edu/terrorist-attacks-jewish-targets-west-2012-2019-atlantic-divide-european-american-attackers/) And of course there is routinely terrorism against Israelis and American Jews alike in Israel. 

**Are pro-Palestinians guilty of stochastic terrorism against Jews? Of course.**

So we have a movement that demonizes Jews, encourages violence against Jews, engages in low level violence against Jews, justifies violence against Jews in Israel....and then pretends like it is (a) not anti-Semitic and (b) opposed to violence against Jews. There is no doubt in my mind that the pro-Palestine movement is at least as guilty of stochastic terrorism as any right wing American talking head, and we should not wait until there is a major terrorist attack on the level described above against Jews in the United States before taking action.

i have been following the Free Palestine movement for years, but not as in deathly as recently. i’m currently reading up more on Hamas, right now i’m trying to understand better, because as i’ve understood it - really who else has fought for Palestinians against an apartheid? i don’t see my country rising support and aid, hell after october 7 it took a week for my country to say anything about Palestine. as much as i feel that, another part of me feels feels specifically suicide bombings for an example are more terrorism than resistance (recognizing resistance is a factor) but at the same time - this ended at about the time a relationship with al-Qa`ida ended and it’s hard not to consider this relationship on influencing those factors. mind you, i don’t know if my understanding of this is accurate and would really appreciate some insight. there is a lot about Hamas i can recognize as a resistance, but at the same time - Palestinians do not deserve to live under any terror and that means both from the regime and their own government. 

i really hope this does not come across as disingenuous or in bad faith. the fact is regardless of whatever praises or concerns regarding Hamas - Hamas wouldn’t exist in the way it does without Israel’s genocide on Palestine. this question isn’t about the existence of a regime - that is not up for debate and whataboutisms are not welcome. this is a question on Hamas, do palestinians feel this is their only option in the face of death and why hamas has had some refer to it as resistance despite the way they’ve hurt palestinians too?",fuckwormbrain,t2_k4jygr10,0.57,1,79

I think it’s so important to listen to Jewish and Palestinian voices during this time, both those in the Levant and elsewhere. One thing I noticed when I was studying was the amount of Jewish academics in various fields who are/have been anti-Zionist - lots of this I just learned incidentally.

When I was studying linguistics, we read a lot of Noam Chomsky, a Jewish-American largely considered the father of modern linguistics. 

When I was studying psychology, we looked at the leading global expert on addiction and trauma, Dr Gabor Mate, a holocaust survivor who was a Zionist as a teenager but is now staunchly anti-Zionist. 

In addition, one of the leading experts on the Holocaust, if not THE leading expert on Holocaust history, Raul Hilberg, has expressed anti-Zionist sentiments, including praise for Norman Finklestein (a Jewish pro-Palestinian with globally recognised expertise on Israel-Palestine) and his book the Holocaust Industry.

On the Palestinian side, a shift from the current approaches to an ODS approach is required. The obvious failure of the [two-state proposal](https://odsi.co/en/index#FAQ_two_state_proposal), as well as the failure of the Palestinian leadership in many respects (including rampant corruption and subjection to foreign powers) are pushing [a growing number of Palestinians to return to the traditional Palestinian call for the establishment of one democratic state from the river to the sea](https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20211126-palestinians-favour-a-one-state-over-a-two-state-solution-poll-finds/). The potential is there, and requires the establishment (or, rather, the reestablishment) of organized Palestinian movements holding this political vision.

Things are more complicated on the Israeli side, as the existence of the Israeli state and society are the consequence and objective of Zionism, of which ODS is the fundamental antithesis. We cannot expect Zionism to shift to democracy, nor are we awaiting such a thing: Democracy’s prevailing entails the defeat of racist, colonial movements such as Zionism. Although the current power balance is, as mentioned, in Zionism’s favor, three main factors can tip it to democracy’s side:

The first is **sustained Palestinian resistance**, armed and unarmed, which can lay bare Zionism’s claim to provide a “land without a people as a safe haven for Jews”.

The second is **international pressure** due to pro-Palestinian efforts and Israel’s further slide into fascism — dubbed [“Israel’s greatest threat”](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/israel-greatest-threat-breakdown-relations-west-inss) by the Institute for National Security Studies.

The third is **Zionism’s inner contradictions**. As an ideology and movement that [politicizes identity](https://www.odsi.co/en/faq_depoliticize_identity), Zionism fragments, not only the societies it targets, but also those it originates from and creates:

* By viewing and treating other states’ Jewish citizens as part of the Israeli state and society rather than their own, Zionism estranges or further estranges them from their own states and societies — which helps explain the apparently contradictory [overlap between Zionism and antisemitism](https://jewishcurrents.org/antisemitic-zionists-arent-a-contradiction-in-terms).
* By enforcing the “Israeli identity” as the sole Jewish identity, Zionism is the source of infighting and disillusionment within Jewish communities themselves, for instance by devaluating non-Israeli Jewish culture (e.g., the abandonment of Yiddish in favor of just Hebrew) or diverting funds away from the communities that raised them, to Israel. This is a major factor in the dwindling support of Israel among non-Israeli Jews.
* Political movements or apparatuses who chose to politicize identity face the burden of having to define it. [Israel has recognized Nazis as “Jewish” and welcomed them to Palestine (!)](https://www.jpost.com/national-news/neo-nazi-gang-leader-gets-5-years-9-months-in-jail) while [questioning the Judaity of and denying citizenship to people who actually identify as Jews](https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3676035,00.html). [Current official Israeli](https://archive.jewishagency.org/education/israel/achievements/oswald-rufeisen-brother-daniel-case/) stances actually refuse to recognize as “Jewish” people who believe in the Torah if they believe in the Gospel as well, while agreeing to recognize as “Jewish” people who do not believe in the Torah at all (!). Current proposed redefinitions of “who is a Jew” threaten to [“cut Israel off from 70% of world Jewry”](https://www.jpost.com/diaspora/article-723901).
* Identity being a social construct, and identitarian groups therefore not being actual interest groups (such as, say, industrialists, farmers, students, low-income families, etc.), an identitarian segmentation of society does not align with its citizens’ or interest groups’ actual interests. This leads to political narratives, discourses, programs and policies that are out of touch with society’s actual needs, focusing instead on difference from the “other”. In Israel’s case, this is made obvious by the [huge and growing socio-economic gap between Israelis themselves](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2021-06-11/ty-article/.premium/when-it-comes-to-education-israels-ashkenazi-mizrahi-divide-is-still-growing/0000017f-f4cd-ddde-abff-fced39a60000) as well as by the shift even further to the right. These are causing an outflux of Israeli [funds](https://www.timesofisrael.com/report-bank-officials-believe-4-billion-moved-out-of-israel-in-recent-weeks/) and [citizens](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2023-03-02/ty-article/.premium/insurance-policy-spike-in-number-of-israelis-applying-for-foreign-citizenship/00000186-9d39-df29-af8e-fdfbc1350000) from Palestine which has prompted the [Bank of Israel chief to warn that “an economic crisis could break out within a moment”](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog-february-23-2023/).
* Identity is, by definition, what makes us different from others. Politicizing it does not end with the original politicized identities, and rather leads to the creation of sub-identities, further fragmenting society by fragmenting the original identitarian group itself, perhaps violently. This is particularly true when dominance and/or homogeneity is achieved by a particular identitarian group, its initial identity thus no longer setting it apart enough to warrant its continuation. This has caused growing inter-Israeli tension between religious and atheist, theocratic and secular, homosexuals and homophobes, Russian and Ukrainian, Ashkenazi and Mizrahim, European and African, and others. In the words of Benny Gantz, [Israeli civil war](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/gantz-says-judicial-reform-plan-will-lead-to-civil-war-in-israel/) is now a possibility Israel has to reckon with.

The chances of Zionism crumbling in our lifetime are high. However, this does not mean that the establishment of a democratic state is guaranteed. Zionism’s demise could lead to chaos, a spiral of racist or sectarian violence, or the establishment of an authoritarian Arab or Islamic state. Hence the need for all to rally not only “against” Zionism but also “with” a clear political objective: The establishment of **One Democratic State, from the river to the sea.**

The purpose of the [One Democratic State Initiative](https://odsi.co) is to mobilize individuals, entities and political parties, in Palestine and abroad, behind such an endeavor. We call on you to [sign up](https://odsi.co/en/sign-up) as a supporter of the One Democratic State solution and to take part in the efforts to make it a reality.",OnePalestine,t2_ljf2mq08,0.51,1,134

1280,17k3upj,2023-10-30,Israel_Palestine,Why because the region would be where world war 3 would probably start it is so important that the war in Israel not escalate and that the Palestinians be granted a state.,"
The Israel-Palestine conflict is a decades-long issue fraught with deep historical, religious, and cultural complexities. While it's not guaranteed that this region would be the epicenter of a hypothetical World War 3, the stakes are extraordinarily high for a multitude of reasons. 

Firstly, key global players like the United States, Russia, and European nations have vested interests in the Middle East. Israel is a strategic ally to many Western nations and receives significant military aid, especially from the U.S. The Palestinians, on the other hand, have backing from other Middle Eastern countries and international organizations. An escalation could easily draw in other powers, setting off a chain reaction of military and political commitments that could spiral into a broader conflict. 

Secondly, the Middle East is pivotal for energy resources, specifically oil and gas. Any conflict that threatens the stability of the region has immediate global economic repercussions. A stable Israel and Palestine are therefore critical to ensuring that these energy channels remain uninterrupted.

Thirdly, the ideological facets of this conflict have the potential to polarize international communities, leading to a much broader ideological war that goes beyond territorial disputes. Religion plays a role, too. Jerusalem is a sacred site for Jews, Muslims, and Christians, and any conflict surrounding it arouses deep-seated religious sentiments globally.

Granting Palestinians a state could alleviate some tensions. Statehood would provide Palestinians with self-determination, which could make diplomatic negotiations easier and decrease motivations for violent resistance. Also, a two-state solution would clarify borders and resource rights, minimizing points of conflict.

In summary, the importance of preventing escalation in the Israel-Palestine conflict and potentially granting Palestinians a state has less to do with avoiding World War 3 specifically, and more to do with mitigating the risk of a multi-faceted, multi-player global conflict that could have severe social, economic, and ideological ramifications.",Georgeo57,t2_dobwkdvep,0.6,1,2

1283,17p5n8o,2023-11-06,Israel_Palestine,The drama triangle and the empowerment triangle,"So I asked ai to put the conflict in the drama triangle and later suggest an option for the empowerment triangle for the conflict.
What do you think? Feel free to add your thoughts and nuances to the discussion.

At first I’ll explain what’s that drama triangle (which is one of my fav terms and helped me figure out so many things in my life)

The Drama Triangle, originally formulated by Dr. Stephen Karpman in 1968, is a psychological and social model of human interaction. The model maps out a type of destructive interaction that can occur between people in conflict. The Drama Triangle consists of three roles:

1. **Victim**: The person who feels oppressed, helpless, or unable to make decisions. They might say things like, ""Poor me!"" or believe that they are at the mercy of others.

2. **Persecutor**: This is the role of the person who pressures, coerces, or blames, acting as an antagonist. They might say, ""It's all your fault!"" or use aggressive behavior to dominate.

3. **Rescuer**: The one who tries to help the Victim, even if the help isn't requested or truly needed. Their actions are sometimes driven by guilt or a need to feel superior. They might say, ""Let me help you,"" even if their assistance fosters the Victim's dependence.

These roles are fluid and can shift during an interaction. For instance, a Rescuer might turn into a Persecutor if they feel unappreciated or if their efforts to help are rejected. Similarly, a Victim might become a Persecutor, blaming others for their problems.

The Drama Triangle is often used in therapeutic settings to highlight patterns of interaction and to encourage healthier ways of relating. For more productive and healthy interactions, some therapists introduce the ""Empowerment Triangle"" which includes the roles of Creator (instead of Victim), Challenger (instead of Persecutor), and Coach (instead of Rescuer).

——————————

Given the complexity and sensitivity of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, it's crucial to approach the application of the Drama Triangle with care and an awareness of potential oversimplifications. That said, if we were to map out the conflict within the Drama Triangle framework, it would look something like this:

## From the Palestinian Perspective:
- **Victim**: Palestine (or Palestinians)
  - Feelings of oppression, occupation, and displacement.
- **Persecutor**: Israel (or Israeli government/military)
  - Viewed as the enforcer of occupation and various restrictions.
- **Rescuer**: Various solutions or international bodies
  - Peace initiatives, two-state solution proposals, or supportive nations/states.

## From the Israeli Perspective:
- **Victim**: Israel (or Israelis)
  - Feelings of being under constant threat, facing rocket attacks, and concerns over security.
- **Persecutor**: Palestinian groups (including but not limited to groups like Hamas)
  - Seen as the initiators of rocket attacks, terror activities, and incitement.
- **Rescuer**: Various solutions or international bodies
  - Peace initiatives, security measures, or supportive nations/states (e.g., the U.S.).

Note that these are just generalizations based on the Drama Triangle framework and don't encompass all the nuances, individual experiences, or historical intricacies of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Additionally, the roles can shift depending on specific events or the timeline being discussed.
—————————————————

The Empowerment Triangle offers a more constructive alternative to the Drama Triangle. Here's a breakdown of the roles:

1. **Creator** (an empowered alternative to the Victim): Takes responsibility for their life, circumstances, and decisions.
2. **Challenger** (an empowered alternative to the Persecutor): Provides constructive challenges that encourage growth, without blaming or oppressing.
3. **Coach** (an empowered alternative to the Rescuer): Supports and guides without taking over or fostering dependence.

Using the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as an example:

## From the Palestinian Perspective:
- **Creator (Palestine or Palestinians)**:
  - Assume responsibility for building a sustainable state, governance, and infrastructure.
  - Engage in diplomatic channels proactively.
  - Prioritize education and economic growth for a better future.
  
- **Challenger (Israel or Israeli government/military)**:
  - Recognize the rights and aspirations of the Palestinian people.
  - Provide constructive feedback and engage in joint projects that build trust.
  - Prioritize diplomacy over military responses.

- **Coach (Various solutions or international bodies)**:
  - Offer guidance and support to foster self-sufficiency and sustainable peace.
  - Mediate disputes and offer resources without taking over the decision-making process.

## From the Israeli Perspective:
- **Creator (Israel or Israelis)**:
  - Assume responsibility for a secure and democratic state.
  - Address concerns of minority populations within Israel.
  - Engage in proactive diplomacy with regional neighbors.
  
- **Challenger (Palestinian groups)**:
  - Offer constructive criticism and engage in peace-building initiatives.
  - Work together on joint projects to foster mutual trust and understanding.

- **Coach (Various solutions or international bodies)**:
  - Offer support and resources for building lasting peace.
  - Encourage dialogue and provide platforms for mutual understanding.

Again, these are generalizations and don't encompass all the intricate nuances of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The Empowerment Triangle's purpose is to encourage constructive engagement and proactive responsibility. In the context of the conflict, it would be about both sides working towards solutions and peace in empowered ways.",yonkiyonki,t2_48tb03ca,1.0,1,5

1285,13u6p79,2023-05-28,Israel_Palestine,Hope and Fear,"The article posted below is an interesting read. 

The author makes a few points on Israel

- Old grudges have morphed into political warfare;

- ‘a cold civil war simmers, fuelled by religion, blood and soil’;

- President Rivlin talks about the split within Israel between Arabs, Ultra-Orthodox, national religious, and secular’. This is reflected in first grade classes in schools;

I would suggest that Rivlin has been simplistic. There are also splits between, black, Mizrahi, Ashkenazi and immigrant groups, further complicating matters. Israeli racism is well documented (obviously not everyone lets it effect their attitudes, especially amongst the secular). 

An ally of Netenyahu, Simcha Rothman expresses a not unfamiliar view that ‘anyone who doesn’t wear a kippa is harming democracy’;

The deceased American Sheldon Adelson, who was a supporter of Israel first and foremost, and his country of residence, the USA, next, claims there is nothing in the bible that says Israel should be democratic, and it needn’t be democratic. 

I would suggest the Palestine issue in the WB and Gaza are directly impacted by this fracture within Israeli society. 

There are much stronger internal fissures that the country has to deal with, and a homeland for Palestinians in the occupied territories is far from politicians, and people’s minds. 

It simply is not on anyone’s agenda as a priority, it’s a side issue. 

Would the Israelis here agree?

1292,zmph2b,2022-12-15,Israel_Palestine,What is Terrorism,"The term terrorism is evocative. It conjures the images of 9/11, innocent lives lost, bombings, human suffering. Very visceral. 

Its use is also has expedient and potent political use. Label violence as terrorism and it's easily understood. The motives or conditions that might've brought it on become irrelevant, and you're left with a good/evil binary. For those who were around during the aftermath of 9/11, this might sound familiar. 

In Israel/Palestine, the terrorist paradigm is ubiquitous. Often, it's a barely concealed euphemism for Arab. It functions to justify ugly policies. 

But what is terrorism exactly? According to the UN: 

“Criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public, a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes are in any circumstance unjustifiable, whatever the considerations of a political, philosophical, ideological, racial, ethnic, religious or any other nature that may be invoked to justify them;”

Obviously, blowing up a bus or pizzeria - which the Palestinians have done - would meet this standard. So would hijacking a plane. It's a politically motivated and inspires fear/terror to general life. 

What about attacking, or even killing a soldier, in an Occupied Territory? I can't comment on the legality, but is it intended to liberate or instil terror? How about bulldozing homes? That's meant as a deterrent for future terrorists, but isn't that provoking a sense of terror? 

To conclude - what is your definition of terrorism? Whats the difference between a terrorist and a freedom fighter?",mikeffd,t2_mat1k,0.53,1,22

1296,zrhm16,2022-12-21,Israel_Palestine,Can the US liberal diaspora do anything?,"I think we can all agree on one thing. That is, the excesses of the Israeli government in the treatment of Palestinians are held back to a degree by the U.S. Administration and citizens (including the American Jewish cohort). 

Whatever we think about it, the US is important (hence the heavy lobbying effort) to Israelis. It is also one of the few consistent supporters of Israel. 

The Biden Administration (for which read Secretary of State Anthony Blinken) has already messaged Netenyahu that he needs to keep his right wing under control. 

We know one thing:- Israeli young are different from diaspora young. 

In the main the young Jewish diaspora are liberal

On the other hand, the Israeli young are nationalistic and right wing. This bodes badly for Palestine peace in the future. 

The attached Haaretz piece is an interesting read. 

It suggests that western liberals are increasingly considering detachment from an Israel that ‘treats them with contempt’. 

(**NSFW:-** The article has some quite nasty descriptions of diaspora by zionist thinkers. 

A historian (it’s in the article) calls the doctrine of ‘shlilat ha’galah’ at times “resembling at times rabid anti semitism”.

One thinker calls diaspora Jewish life ‘parasitism of a fundamentally useless people’. Another calls them the ‘ugly, sickly (rude word)’ and another that diaspora are only ‘playing with Jewishness’, reform Jews ‘worse than holocaust deniers’ etc etc.)

In view of the lurch towards extremism (Smotrich, Ben Gvir, Maoz, Fogel), is it time for diaspora Jews and citizens to take a stronger stand against Israel?

Where are the protests outside Congress to stop funding this rogue state? 

Or do people just feel helpless both abroad and at home to this fascist takeover? 

Or not care. It’s not their country.

1298,158etex,2023-07-24,Israel_Palestine,Can we all agree killing people is worse than building a house?,"During 2020, when Black Lives Matter protests would occasionally dissolve into spontaneous outbursts of rioting, a narrative emerged that critics of BLM were more outraged about the destruction of property than they were about the police killings of unarmed black men. A few examples:

*""Over the past week, a certain narrative has taken root—one that considers property damage to be a bigger problem than the continued massacre of Black people by police, and that views military action as a proportional response to mass nationwide protests. It’s despicable—albeit predictable—messaging from a U.S. president who has never hidden his disdain for Black lives, further bolstered by Republican members of Congress.... This reverence for property is inextricably tied with the United States’ devaluation of Black lives""* - [New America.](https://www.newamerica.org/weekly/black-lives-matter-more-property/)

*""Nevertheless, much of the finger-wagging has been about property destruction, and it is dismaying to see that some are more upset about broken glass than public killing – or rather that they seem to believe society ought to rest on a foundation of stable property relations, not human rights and justice.""* - [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/01/george-floyd-riots-violence-damage-property-police-brutality)

*“Property damage is nowhere near the value of human life,”* they said.

*""People are not objects; broken windows and burnt cars are simply not commensurate with the violence of state-sanctioned murder or the structural violence of poverty that has placed people of color at a disproportionate risk of dying of Covid-19. Plateglass windows don’t bleed. They don’t die and leave loved ones grieving. They don’t contribute to the collective trauma and terror experienced by their communities. They just break, and then, at some point, they are replaced by identical sheets of glass.""* - [Newsweek](https://www.thenation.com/article/activism/blm-looting-protest-vandalism/)

I am reminded of this every time a pro-Palestinian, in their endless quest to justify Palestinian war crimes and terrorism, trots out the old whatabouting talking point of ""Yes, Palestine attacks civilians and uses human shields, but Israel builds settlements and demolishes houses, that is ALSO against international law."" The idea that these two actions are somewhat offsetting or equivalent to one another is laughable, and yet the pro-Palestinians keep saying it.

The truth is that Palestine's lawbreaking and Israel's ""lawbreaking"" are so different they should not even be talked about in the same breath. Even if we agree with the Palestinian narrative that Israel's settlement construction is against international law, [which Israelis can vigorously and persuasively argue it is not,](https://theweek.com/articles/671481/why-israeli-settlements-are-not-illegal) for a Palestine sycophant to point fingers at the Israelis for building houses while standing on the corpses of dead families is as morally odious as a Blue Lives Matter activist finger wagging at BLM supporters for breaking windows. I agree with BLM that human life, even Jewish life, is worth more than property. Do you?

Notice that this same dichotomy would also apply to Israeli demolitions of houses where terrorists lived as a form of deterrence. As inconvenient as it is for the people who used to live in that house, having your house demolished is not even close to having a loved one killed in a terrorist attack. In fact to even talk about them in the same sentence is insulting to the victims. Houses do not bleed, and they do not leave loved ones grieving. A house that has been destroyed by Israel will be rebuilt, usually by UNRWA. But the innocent people murdered by Palestine in cold blood can never come back.

It would also apply to the many occasions in which Palestine has turned down peace treaties that could have ended the conflict because the offer did not give them enough property, as well as when Abbas famously refused to even negotiate with the Israelis until they froze settlement construction. This reverence for property is inextricably tied with the Palestinian devaluation of Jewish lives. Pro-Palestinians like to moan about how unfair it is that the UN Partition Plan gave the Jews 54% of the land and the Arabs only 46%. Was that 8% of the West Bank really worth tens of thousands of lives, mostly Palestinian ones? And today Palestine is quite content to let the killing on both sides continue in the hope of gaining more property at a later time, apparently, which says a hell of a lot about them.

Finally, this would also apply to the pro-Palestinian talking point ""I want to live in my grandfather's house."" [Example.](https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2022/8/28/tracking-down-the-house-israel-stole-from-my-grandfather) Let me put this as clearly as I can: fuck your grandfather and fuck your grandfather's house. I don't fucking care that he lost his house, and that you want to live in it. I don't give a fuck. That house is not worth a single hair on an Israeli child's head, let alone thousands of Israeli lives. You want to live in your grandfather's house? I want the tens of thousands of Israelis murdered by Palestine to still be alive. Looks like neither of us are going to get what we want.

Oh and by the way, if the two sides were reversed, and the Israelis were the ones turning down peace treaties and stabbing families to death because ""they built a house on muh stolen land,"" I would feel the exact same way.

So with that in mind, can all of us here in this subreddit agree that human life is worth more than property? Can we agree killing civilians in cold blood, as Palestine does, is worse than building houses, as Israel does, even if both are forbidden under international law? I don't think it's too much to ask.

1.How much money does israel get form other countries etc.

2. How much money does USA give to Israel Vs Palestinian state?

1300,17b8nxe,2023-10-19,Israel_Palestine,If Hamas decided to kill a hostage each day until Palestine is granted a state...,"

There doesn't seem to be any way that military attempts to rescue the hostages will not end up killing many Gaza citizens and Israeli soldiers. Thousands, if not tens of thousands, of civilians would die. A grounded assault might also provoke Hezbollah, Iran and others to get involved. All of this may actually set off a World War III.

What do you think would happen if Hamas begin killing hostages as a way of forcing Israel to grant the Palestinians statehood? What would happen if Hamas did this to hasten the end of the war and the winning of Palestinian freedom?

Imagine we were ten days into this scenario. Israel would still faces the same unwinnable dilemma. If they launched a ground assault on two million Gaza citizens who were sitting ducks with no place to escape, the world may not forgive Israel for such a brutal violation of international law and basic morality. 

If Hamas were to do this, it would certainly be terrible. But if the killings convinced Israel to grant the Palestinians sovereignty, thereby ending the war with no more casualties on either side, this would seem to be a more favorable outcome in terms of saving lives. 

Israel has a choice of avenging a horrible wrong done them in a way that inevitably takes the lives of thousands of more Israelis and Palestinians or choosing wisdom and compassion over hateful revenge by finally granting the Palestinian people a homeland.

No one has a crystal ball. Let's hope and pray that whatever happens results in the fewest more deaths and the fastest ending of the war.",Georgeo57,t2_dobwkdvep,0.5,0,49

Every last one with blood on it’s hands. 

Especially the IDF. 

The terrorist group with the most blood on its hands is of course the IDF. It gets billions of dollars from the Israeli government to butcher civilians, it gets foreign aid and weapons as well and it has acted in a far more barbaric method than any Palestinian terrorist group. It’s also far older and has been committing atrocities for far longer than Hamas and the PLO. 

And not just that one terrorist group in Israel, let’s disband and jail all of them. The Hilltop Youth, the Yesha Council, Likud. All of them.  Past and present members. No more excuses for terrorists. 

Yes, I know. It would mean jailing almost 60% of the population and leaving only the Ultra Orthodox and the Arabs to run things. Israel would have to build dozens of new prisons. The US can redirect the billions in aid it used to give the IDF to a more worthwhile and humanitarian cause.

This shift is an opportunity, as it lays bare the true nature of Zionism, and the incompatibility between the existence of a “Jewish state” and a “democratic state”. These developments will have a double impact as Israelis themselves start to feel the heat of their state's fascist nature, on one hand, and as the international community moves to condemn and isolate Israel.

The opportunities presented to us must not be taken for granted. Making use of them requires that activists be rallied around an alternative political solution. The recently launched One Democratic State Initiative aims to be such a network and is reaching out to individuals, entities and political parties, in Palestine and abroad, in a call for organized political action around a political vision that forms the fundamental antithesis of Zionism: One Democratic State in Palestine.

1310,174w2py,2023-10-10,Israel_Palestine,"Why Israel Is (Slightly) Worse Than Palestine, and Western Media Is Just Covering it Up","Both sides- Israel and Palestine- have their flaws. Palestine has many- it is far from perfect, ridden with rape, assault, terrorism and torture. Palestine is home to a major terrorist group, Hamas, which is funded by Iran (Please note that whilst Turkiye and Qatar have given Palestine international backing, it isn’t as major as the backing given by Iran). They rape, assault, torture and kidnap innocent Israeli citizens. They also launched a deadly surprise attack on an Israeli music festival. 58% of Palestinians on the Gaza Strip support Hamas and 42% of Palestinians in the West Bank support Hamas. But, I would assume that most Palestinians only support Hamas because they are their only chance at freedom (for themselves, their family and their country).

Now, onto the flaws of Israel- which there are MANY. They have also culled and tortured innocent Palestinians for *many* years. They have denied them citizenship and basic rights. They too have attacked and occupied Palestine. They too have launched deadly surprise attacks on Palestine. But Israel has done something I believe to be truly horrific. Truly animal-like. They cut off all fuel, water and food in Palestine- denying them basic necessities for survival. Israel launched a siege on Palestine. Their reasoning for this was that they were fighting/dealing with ‘human animals‘. I believe that cutting off basic resourced for millions of people is one of the worst crimes you can commit. Israel has done much more damage than Palestine has. Whilst I am not saying Palestine hasn’t done anything bad- it has committed its fair share of war crimes- Israel has committed  many war crimes and violation of human rights. Even the UN, which I believe to be biased in Israels’ favour, says that both have committed war crimes.

But, why don’t you hear about this in the media? It is quite simple, really. Israel is allies with the USA, which is allies with most other countries in the world (the UK, Australia, NATO). So, unless you live in Asia, Russia or the Middle East, I can guarantee that almost all (if not all) articles published in your country are biased towards Israel. They call the attack on Israel ‘evil’ whilst they have been doing much worse to Palestine, for a much longer her time! For decades, Israel has suppressed the Palestinians and treated them as lesser beings! But the second Palestine even dares to do *something* to stand up to its’ oppressors, it gets flamed in the news. My own prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has called the attack ‘indiscriminate’ and lit up the Sydney Opera House in Israeli colours! Just because he wants to suck up to Daddy Biden, Daddy Sunak and the USA! Not only this, but a recent Reddit post has brought to my attention the fact that Israelites murdered are referred to as ‘Israelites killed’ whilst Palestinians murdered are just referred to as ‘Palestinians death’.

Whilst both sides have their flaws, Israel certainly has more. And these flaws are greater in number and greater in severity. They cut off water, food and fuel to innocents. They attack, torture and oppress millions of people whilst occupying THEIR rightful land. And the media portrays Israel as a cute, little Angel. I can’t bare to live in a country which does this.

1311,14nyl4r,2023-07-01,Israel_Palestine,Anti-immigrant violence,"I frequently notice pro-zionist posters use the early Arab violence against Jews as justification for the mass murder and ethnic cleansing that zionists used to make their state ""Jewish"".

Anti-immigrant violence has a long history in countries built on immigration, such as the U.S., for example against the Irish - see [https://www.history.com/news/when-america-despised-the-irish-the-19th-centurys-refugee-crisis](https://www.history.com/news/when-america-despised-the-irish-the-19th-centurys-refugee-crisis) : ""anti-Irish mobs in Philadelphia destroyed houses and torched churches in the deadly Bible Riots of 1844. ""  At least 14 people were killed.  It was a long time before Catholics were fully accepted.  

Question: would this anti-immigrant violence have justified the Irish (or Chinese, or \[pick your immigrant group\] ethnically cleansing the existing U.S. Protestant/white population to create a ""Catholic Irish"" state like the zionists did in Palestine?

The cases are dissimilar of course.  Pretty much every immigrant to the U.S. comes with the hope becoming good citizens of the existing country, finding freedom and new opportunity, integrating in to the U.S. (though part of that was pushing out the true Native Americans).  Not so for the zionists to Palestine, a large and leading portion of them wanted to get rid of the existing people by one way or another, and held discussions about ways and means to accomplish this - the main ways were either violence or legalized racism.  The JNF put covenants on land it purchased saying it could only be used by Jews, such covenants are in place today AFAIK.  Part of the Herzl's idea was to reduce opportunities for the indigenous people so that they would leave, it's unknown how much he expressed that to other zionists.

There was some anti-zionist violence leading up to the founding of Israel, the indigenous people didn't want their state to be ""Jewish"", the zionists wanted a Jewish state, leading zionists had the goal of a Jewish state with as few non-Jews as they could manage.  When it became clear that the indigenous people weren't going to get up and leave on their own, & firing, not hiring or evicting the indigenous people because they weren't Jewish just led to a lot of unemployed people with a grudge, most leading zionists condoned forced removal.

Israel has not quite been side-lined but other avenues of talks with Israeli ‘enemies’ is gaining momentum.

1315,173xrk7,2023-10-09,Israel_Palestine,Steps to a regional non-aggression pact in exchange for a Palestinian state to end the war.,"

1. **All parties involved must agree to the principle of a two-state solution, with Israel and Palestine living side-by-side in peace and security.**
2. **The parties must then negotiate the terms of a non-aggression pact.** This pact should include provisions for:
    * The withdrawal of Israeli forces from the occupied Palestinian territories.
    * The establishment of a Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital.
    * A just and fair solution to the issue of Palestinian refugees.
    * A strong enforcement mechanism to ensure that the pact is not violated.
3. **Once the pact is negotiated, it must be signed by all parties involved.** This signing ceremony should be attended by high-level representatives from the region and the international community.
4. **The pact must then be ratified by the legislatures of all parties involved.**
5. **Once the pact is ratified, it will come into force.** At this point, all parties involved will be legally bound to uphold the terms of the pact.

It is important to note that this is just a general outline. The specific steps involved in negotiating and implementing a regional non-aggression pact will vary depending on the specific circumstances of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

Here are some additional considerations:

* **The involvement of the international community is essential.** The international community can play a role in mediating negotiations between the parties, providing financial and technical assistance, and guaranteeing the implementation of the pact.
* **The pact must be supported by the people of the region.** It is important to build public support for the pact through education and outreach programs.
* **The pact must be flexible enough to adapt to changing circumstances.** The parties involved should be prepared to review and update the pact as needed.

Achieving a regional non-aggression pact in exchange for a Palestinian state will be a complex and challenging process. However, it is a possible way to end the war and bring peace to the region.

It might be over 100 years until ""Greater Israel"" (whatever it might be called) is finally founded, but I nonetheless promote that Israel look toward constructively engaging in their region with a long term goal of forming a Union like the EU, within which would be located all the holy sites of the Abrahamic religions.

I want the next generation of Muslims to engage with the Zionist movement, and to seek to align Jewish and Islamic interests in the Middle East, in order that together we might work to both stabilise and develop the region in a future where oil is no longer a cornerstone of the global economy.

I have no new suggestions regarding a solution to the conflict in Israel and Palestine other than to comment that a two state solution in South Africa would have been much preferable for the ""Population Group: White"" than what ended up eventuating, and that I believe that Israel should act unilaterally and pull the plaster of both quickly and for once and for always.

The right of return has been a cherished goal of Palestinians for 75 years and counting. It is no closer now than it was then. Nor is there any practical way to achieve it. Nor does anyone have a strategy to achieve it that has any chance of working. Indeed, the insistence on it has only added to the suffering of Palestinians.

Israel will always insist on being a majority-Jewish state, and that means no right of return. Whether that is just or not is not the point. There is no way to get Israel to back down on this. This is a nuclear-armed religious state. 

Demonstrations and protests have been taking place around the world. And yet almost no protest calls for one thing. And almost no one criticizes them for not calling for it:

No one is calling for their country to accept Palestinian refugees.

There were millions of refugees from the wars in Iraq and Syria. Many more refugees continue to stream out of Somalia, Ethopia, Sudan, South Sudan, Yemen, and Libya. There is a constant tension in Europe between those who want to accept some and those who don't.

But there is no such dispute over Palestinians. No one wants to take Palestinian refugees. Neither their friends nor their enemies. It is apparently better to let Palestinians suffer hopelessly in squalor and occupation and blockade for decades than give up the right of return. 

The consequences of this are devastating. We don't know what is going to happen in Gaza. We had 75 years to do a peaceful resettlement. Now we don't even have 75 days. Now it may be too late. We dont' know how many Gazans will survive this war, or what homes will be left for them to come back to.

The bitter irony is this has happened before. During World War II, even those countries actually fighting Nazi Germany, ostensibly to save Jews from being massacred, refused to take in Jewish refugees. In fact that crisis is related to this one; some of the refugees actually wanted to settle in the US or UK, but were sent to Palestine instead. Today, the memories of the Holocaust fuel Israeli paranoia and desire to avoid a multi-religious state.

But where could the refugees go? The numbers are daunting. There are about 7.1 million Jews in Israel and the territories, compared to 7.7 million Palestinians; that is 52 percent of the total. Even to get them down to 40 percent would require almost three million people (ie almost all the West Bank) to go. Israel would probably not end apartheid for anything less than 70 percent, which raises the total to 4.6 million emigres.

Nonetheless, let's illustrate the problem with 40 percent, that is 2.9 million Palestinians moving abroad. Where?

I think a few simple rules can do it:

1. Only countries that are more prosperous than the occupied territories should take refugees.
2. 60 percent should go to majority-Muslim countries, the rest to the rest of the world.
3. Each country should take in a number of refugees proportionate to their GDP, not their population.
4. Countries that already took in a large number of Syrian refugees in recent years should have their quota reduced accordingly.

That second rule is, to be fair, arbitrary, but I don't think it's unfair to ask majority-Muslim countries to take majority-Muslim refugees. It's true that a Palestinian emigrating to Morocco will be in an environment almost as foreign to them as France.

Rule 1 has the advantage of ruling out countries that are already hosting many Palestinians (eg Lebanon or Jordan) or refugees from Sudan or Syria (such as Egypt or Turkey). It also rules out most of the countries themselves embroiled in war and in no position to take refugees. It does not rule out Russia or China, but because of the strong likelihood of official persecution in these countries, they are also left off.

Rule 4 takes some countries - Turkey, Egypt, Germany, Sweden, Netherlands, etc  - off the list entirely. The UK, France, and Spain remain but have lower numbers than their GDP would call for.

Some definitions:

\- we use Human Development Index (HDI) to qualify Rule 1;

\- the GDP is PPP-adjusted; we're after a mix of standard of living times population, not overall economic clout.

We get the following list:

Now what is the point of this list? After all, let's be realistic, I don't think a single country listed would accept even a tenth of the numbers I've assigned to them. 

And yet...is there any other humane solution? I don't believe there is. How is leaving Palestinians there to suffer and die under occupation, blockade, and apartheid any better? How is it humane to leave them, abandoned, at the mercy of one regime that hates them and another that uses them as cannon fodder? Millions of refugees from many other countries have built new and successful lives abroad, why should this opportunity be denied Palestinians?

For the right of return? Return to what? Return to a city reduced to rubble? Return to a graveyard? Drop the fiction of a two-state solution. All it demonstrates is how unserious the world is. For over 75 years Israel has made it clear that they will never, ever, ever accept a Palestinian state. They will not give up the West Bank. They will not give up Jerusalem. And they have nuclear weapons.

For decades the world has toyed with Palestinians, offering them crumbs of aid and tepid political support, but no concrete help, such as a place to live. Now that is breaking down. Very soon they may be forced to move or die. We will see whether the world abandons them, just as it abandoned Jews in World War II.",tdpz1974,t2_199s8d7u,0.3,0,25

1323,z0z5u6,2022-11-21,Israel_Palestine,"The Palestinian ""Struggle"" is for Property","When you first learn about the Civil War, you will probably first believe that it was fought over slavery. The Confederacy didn't want to free their slaves, the Union did want the slaves free. Then you might learn a little more about the subject, and learn about the Confederacy's point of view, and think that it was actually fought over ""state's rights."" That the Confederacy and the Union had different views about how the states should decide their own destiny in contrast to the federal government, and slavery was just a flashpoint that broke open a larger issue. But then you learn a little more about the Civil War, and you learn that ""state's rights"" was just a poor excuse to keep millions of innocent people in bondage just because the Confederates didn't want to give up their ""property.""

Similarly, Palestinians and their supporters have learned very well to ape the language of human rights in order to gain allies in the West. In truth though, the Palestinian struggle is actually a struggle for property, just like that of the Confederacy, and not human rights, freedom, international law, or any other high minded ideal. In fact you'll find this is just the opposite. The proof is not hard to find, simply look back in history:

**The rejection of peace offers.**

The Palestinians have received many peace offers over the last century, and have rejected them all. And when confronted about why, their apologists always say it's because not enough property was offered. The classic example of the 1948 Partition Plan being rejected is justified because it wasn't ""fair"" that the Arabs, who were the majority of the territory, didn't get the majority of the land, even though they got the best and most fertile land. And to hear it from the apologists today, the Jews had no right to *any* land anywhere because they were ""colonialists,"" which is just right wing nationalist talk for foreigners, immigrants, people with a different skin color, etc.

The Palestinian struggle is a struggle for property.

In 2000, the Palestinian leadership wouldn't compromise on Jerusalem or the ""return"" of refugees, which is another way of saying they wanted territory Israel has and didn't want to give up claims to it. 

The Palestinian struggle is a struggle for property.

In the last round of peace talks, Mahmoud Abbas wouldn't negotiate with Israel until...what? Until Israel stopped building settlements. Even though supposedly the Palestinians are being ethnically cleansed, subject to genocide, being treated worse than blacks under apartheid, and every day is a living hell for them. Settlements are the top priority for Palestine:

https://www.reuters.com/article/us-palestinians-israel-idUSTRE78O0QQ20110926

The Palestinian struggle is a struggle for property.

When Palestine apologists try to defend Palestinian human rights abuses, what's the first thing they always say? ""Oh yeah, well Israel builds settlements! That's against international law too!"" As if building a house is morally equivalent to a suicide bombing.

The Palestinian struggle is a struggle for property.

But perhaps no better example of this is the shrieking, hysterical reaction of pro-Palestinians to the idea of making peace via **the Jordanian option.** We discussed it in these past threads:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel_Palestine/comments/vqiaeu/saudi_pundit_makes_shocking_suggestion_jordanian/

https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel_Palestine/comments/uvb6ci/why_not_have_palestine_merge_with_jordan/

Ironically, the Jordanian option would in fact provide for the Palestinians many of the rights and freedoms the Palestinians are allegedly fighting for without them needing to compromise with a single Israeli:

Free of occupation? They won't live under occupation, they'll be Jordanian citizens.

Equal rights? In Jordan, they can live in an Arab state just like Palestine in which everyone has equal rights....allegedly.

What about the ""right of return"" for refugees? We've been told many times that the Palestinians don't sincerely believe that all 10 million fake refugees are going to move to Israel, they just claim it as a bargaining chip for negotiations. So the claim of return is no obstacle to a Jordanian option, the refugees would not be moving anywhere anyway.

Live in their own homeland? Why can't Jordan be their homeland? And since the West Bank is clearly part of their homeland, that won't change if Jordan is the one administering it and ruling it instead of Israel.

State of their own and self-determination? Ethnic based states are racist and apartheid, or at least that's what pro-Palestinians have been telling us for half a century. Why then should the Palestinians get one? If anything, their own arguments should dictate the opposite.

Jordan doesn't want it? Well Israel doesn't want the ""one state solution,"" yet that doesn't seem to matter to pro-Palestinians.

What it all comes down to, and the point of this, is that Palestinians are not fighting to be free of occupation, or for their ""rights."" They want their ""homes"" [read: property] in Israel ""back"" even though the vast majority of them have no homes in Israel. And they want East Jerusalem, or maybe all of Jerusalem, depending on their mood and who's talking at the moment. These are not human rights, not human rights at all, they are property. 

Fighting for property, even to reclaim allegedly lost property, is not a moral struggle. It certainly doesn't justify mass murder or crimes against humanity. Russia claims it has a right to Ukrainian property as well, and the civilians it kills are not given a single thought.

The Palestinian struggle is a struggle for property.

And human life is more important than property.

1330,17hoqr0,2023-10-27,Israel_Palestine,A pro Israeli debunking some myths,"## Genocide

1. Israel warns civilians in Gaza to prevent loss of life. Both by 'knocking' on the roof of the building and by dropping flyers.
2. Israel use precision guided ammunition to lower as possible the amount of collateral damage. Some strikes are not against a whole building, instead just burning a single floor and leaving the rest of the building intact.
3. Genocide is the wanting to alienate an entire group of people, Israel does not intend to kill Palestinians civilians in the West Bank, Gaza or Israeli Arabs.
4. The population of Palestinians in both the West Bank and Gaza has grown faster than the Jewish Population since 1948.
5. Accusing Israel of genocide has the collateral effect of diminishing real acts of genocide – such as those that occurred in the Holocaust, against Armenians, and in Rwanda.

## Carpet Bombing

1. Carpet bombing can be named the most brutal war tactic in human history, even more than nuclear weapons.
2. It is mainly bombing a city without designating a particular purpose, just to kill as many as possible.
3. Israel does target specific buildings that host Hamas ammunition or other military possession.

## The land was stolen

1. There are both genetic and architectural evidences that Jews, the ethnic race, came from the holy land and are connected to it.
2. The Palestinians were offered a land in 1947 by the UN as well and refused it.

## What is Zionism

1. The term ""Zionism"" was coined in the mid 19th century, it means that the Jews should live in the holy land (Zion) in safety and peace.
2. On August 29th 1897 the first Zionist congress was assembled by Benjamin Ze'ev Hertzel, which is known as the prophet of the Israeli state. The reason for that assembly was to plan granting a land for the Jewish race.
3. Zionism is not about killing Palestinians, it is simply about granting Jews peace after millennials of hatred.

## Colonialism

1. the definition of the word 'Colony' is: ""a country or area controlled politically by a more powerful country that is often far away""
2. Israel is not controlled by another state. it is independent, so it's cannot be a colony.
3. Jews deserve a land as well. Throughout history, Jews were massacred, most notably the Holocaust and the Spanish Inquisition.

## Why more Gazans die compared to Israelis

1. Israel has poured billions upon billions on building rocket shelters, rocket detection alarms and obviously the Iron Dome. Without those, the amount of dead Israeli will most likely be higher than the number of dead Gazans.
2. Hamas often designate his dead members as dead civilians or dead children in the reports of its health ministry.

## Apartheid

1. according to international law, Apartheid can only happen to an entire racial group in a certain country.
2. Israel does not discriminate based on racial profiling, as Israeli Arabs have the exact same rights and citizenship as Jews in Israel. Israeli Arabs can also live in West Bank settlements and receive the same rights and protections as their Jewish contra parts.

## Hamas and Gazans

1. Hamas took control of Gaza in a military coup against the PA
2. Hamas treats it population like subhumans, estimates by The Insider news outlet Hamas has a military budget of 300 million dollars. That amount of money could have been used to better the living situation in Gaza
3. Hamas is the sovereign in Gaza. It controls all government ministries.
4. The Hamas ministry of Education brainwashing the Gazans children to hate Jews and deny the Holocaust.

## Nakba

1. Like any war, the Israeli independence war caused a mass refuge migration out of the area of fighting.
2. Most of the Arab population did so either voluntarily or to escape the horror of war.
3. The reports of the number of Palestinians who fled due to Israeli aggressions is highly  inflated, while it's true that the prime minister of Israel, David Ben Gurion, called to expel the Arab population of Israel, there is little evident that it actually took place.

## Palestine before 1984

1. There wasn't an independent state in the holy land from 63 BCE (When the Roman Empire conquered it) until 1948. The area was always controlled by a foreign power.
2. During the 1929 Palestine riots, rioters from the Arab population in the area made a series of pogroms and killed a total of 133 Jews in the area under the British Mandate. Tensions between both populations continued since then until and after Israel claimed independence.

## Gaza as an open air prison

1. Egypt and Israel both share a border with Gaza. During peacetimes, Egypt can and is moving supplies to and from the Gaza Strip.
2. Up until the 2023 war with Hamas, Israel allowed tens of thousands of Gazans to arrive daily into Israel to work in areas like construction and agricultural. The Gazans workers receive the same minimum wage and employees rights as any other Israeli.

## Hamas as a terror organisation

1. Hamas is considered a terrorist organization by the US, EU, UK and other major countries.
2. Hamas use human shields and launch rockets from civilian buildings, in the hope that Israel will retaliate and kill as many Gazans as possible.
3. Hamas also steal humanitarian supply sent to Gaza for its offensive operations.

## War Crimes

1. Using White Phosphorus is legal by international law as long as it's not directly used against civilians. It is legal to use White Phosphorus to conceal positions and show targets. There are no visual evident of Palestinians civilians with burning marks that are caused by exposure to White Phosphorus.
2. Under International law, a blockade or a siege of civilian population is a legal process in a time of war as long as it officially declared as an act of war. A siege of civilian populations is not considered an act of collected punishment.
3. According to the Rome Accords, hospitals, Religious institutions and other protected buildings can be directly directed in case they host military infrastructure.

## The West Bank

1. The West Bank is mostly governed by the PA (Palestinian Authority). it is divided to areas A, B and C according to who is responsible for Security operation.
2. Hamas was the second-largest party in the most recent elections in the West Bank in 2006 and according to polls for the cancelled 2021 election it would have been the wining party.
3. The leader of the PA, Mahmud Abbas (also known as Abu Mazen) is a known Holocaust denier.

## The treatment of Palestinians in the Middle East

1. After the State of Israel gained independence, around 110,000 Palestinians settled in Lebanon. The Lebanese people and government consider them as second class citizens since then and even today. They live in overcrowd camps and several of the camps were massacred throughout the years. One massacre in 1976 in the camps of Tal al-Za‘atar and Jisr al-Basha has killed over 4000 Palestinians. Even today, the Palestinians in Lebanon live in poverty and experience racist discrimination.
2. Around half of the population of Jordan are of Palestinian origin, yet they are underrepresented in the Jordanian government and more likely to be arrested and tortured by the Jordanian police. In 1970 the Palestinian terror group Black September had a failed Coup against the Jordanian king, the aftermath of the coup included a genocide of thousands of Palestinians by the Jordanian monarchy.

1332,17hvuze,2023-10-27,Israel_Palestine,"""What is a Jew?"" Thoughts?","These days, Judaism is a religion, ethnicity, and a political movement.

 So, anyone who belongs to one or more of the 3 is a Jew to at least one group of the various Jewish groups.

 Unfortunately, the political Judaism started about 100 or so years ago in Europe, where people absorbed the cruelty of the fascist political systems  that prevailed across that part of the world. When Europe started criminalizing fascist politics, the political ideology escaped to the parts of the world where it can nest. 

 Political Judaism gave birth to itself from the beautiful Jewish idea ""The right for Jewish people to have a homeland,"" and that's  something that everyone should stand for because it's part of the bigger idea that everyone have a right to have a homeland. Nobody should be forced to leave their homelands and live in strange lands no matter where in the world they are. The Palestinians(the people of the region of Palestine - the religious capital of the Abrahamic religions) even had last names like Zion, Abu Zion, Bani Zion, Ben Zion,...,  for many generations in support of that same idea, ""Zionism,"" and it's not a surprise since the majority of the people there descend from ethnic Jews.

 Political Judaism, Unfortunately, absorbed too much from the cruel fascist systems of Europe and molded a new Idea from both zionism and fascism ""The right of Jewish people to have a Jewish(only) homeland."" They named this new idea a very original name, ""Zionism,"" and called the political judaism ""the zionist movement."" As Europe started  cracking down on fascist ideologies, the new zionist movement put its eyes on the region of Palestine.

  The Palestinian region was already subscribed to Zionism in its original definition, as it's both home to ethnic Jewish descendents and the holy land for Judaism the religion. All was missing was the Political Judaism, the new zionist movement. That's where the fascist inspired Zionist political ideology had to move to from Europe.

 The zionist movement took advantage of the victimhood of the ethic and religious jews and also took advantage of the fascist European support to expel all the jews. They took all that support and aimed it at the Palestinian region. Forming their nest, calling it ""Israel,"" from the slogan of the Palestinian region ""The Land of Israel."" 

 The ethnic Jewish descendants, the people of the Palestinian region, didn't agree with the new definition of Zionism and with the fascist ideas that this new zionist movement brought with it. 

But with all the support from Europe and the West, and with the Palestinian region taking in refugees from all over the world, the zionist movement disowned all the Jewish descendants in Palestine who belonged to any religion other than Judaism. They stripped them of their Jewish history and of their right to their homeland. Then, they set up a monopoly over Judaism. 

 Funding can make any idea come to life, good or bad.  Now, the definition of Judaism is in the hands of this zionist movement that's sitting in its nest ""Israel"" in Palestine. 

  Nobody agrees that Judaism is an ethnicity, religion, and a political movement because it's not, and one of those does not belong. And I agree with everybody, one of them has to go, and we all know which one. 

 So, in conclusion, a Jew is an ethnoreligious identity, including both ethnicity and religion. But this identity is under attack by a political parasite. So, God have mercy on their souls.",SlowMoeFoe,t2_3zdqxbi2,0.2,0,26
