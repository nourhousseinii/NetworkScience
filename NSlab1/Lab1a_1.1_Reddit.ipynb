Each library serves a specific purpose, enabling us to work with Reddit's data and perform data manipulation tasks.\n","\n","- **Pandas (pd)**: We use the `pandas` library to manipulate and analyze data. It's particularly well-suited for handling structured data in a tabular format, which aligns with our data analysis needs.\n","\n","- **Time**: The `time` module is included to enable us to introduce controlled time delays within our code. These delays, implemented using `time.sleep()`, are essential for managing the rate at which we make requests to Reddit's API. This helps avoid overloading the API and encountering rate-limiting issues.\n","\n","- **Datetime**: The `datetime` module is included to enable us to map UTC codes into readable format of day/hour.\n","\n","- **PRAW (Python Reddit API Wrapper)**: For accessing Reddit's API, we utilize the `praw` library. It provides a convenient interface for interacting with Reddit, allowing us to retrieve posts, comments, and perform various actions on the platform.\n","\n","- **PRAW Exceptions**: The `praw.exceptions` module is imported to handle specific exceptions that might arise during our interactions with Reddit's API. These exceptions include rate limit errors, connection issues, and other potential problems that could occur when retrieving data from Reddit.\n","\n","In summary, this initial step equips us with the necessary tools to interact with Reddit's API, fetch data, and effectively process it for analysis. We're now prepared to use these libraries in subsequent steps to retrieve and analyze data from Reddit.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"aERTP65vM40O","outputId":"60f0f5a1-65f4-4e38-dd44-e907da3c2451","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1699949134200,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":16590,"user":{"displayName":"erseghe@dei.unipd.it","userId":"02226207360190315869"}}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Mounted at /content/drive\n"]}],"source":["from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/drive')"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"Z5YJf6fjM3Nx","outputId":"b987079e-a8c8-413f-9e3b-b0a5fc40a417","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1699949146028,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":7151,"user":{"displayName":"erseghe@dei.unipd.it","userId":"02226207360190315869"}}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Collecting praw\n","  Downloading praw-7.7.1-py3-none-any.whl (191 kB)\n","\u001b[?25l     \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m0.0/191.0 kB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m?\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m-:--:--\u001b[0m\r\u001b[2K     \u001b[91m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m\u001b[91m╸\u001b[0m\u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m122.9/191.0 kB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m3.5 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:01\u001b[0m\r\u001b[2K     \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m191.0/191.0 kB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m3.9 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[?25hCollecting prawcore<3,>=2.1 (from praw)\n","  Downloading prawcore-2.4.0-py3-none-any.whl (17 kB)\n","Collecting update-checker>=0.18 (from praw)\n","  Downloading update_checker-0.18.0-py3-none-any.whl (7.0 kB)\n","Requirement already satisfied: websocket-client>=0.54.0 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from praw) (1.6.4)\n","Requirement already satisfied: requests<3.0,>=2.6.0 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from prawcore<3,>=2.1->praw) (2.31.0)\n","Requirement already satisfied: charset-normalizer<4,>=2 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from requests<3.0,>=2.6.0->prawcore<3,>=2.1->praw) (3.3.2)\n","Requirement already satisfied: idna<4,>=2.5 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from requests<3.0,>=2.6.0->prawcore<3,>=2.1->praw) (3.4)\n","Requirement already satisfied: urllib3<3,>=1.21.1 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from requests<3.0,>=2.6.0->prawcore<3,>=2.1->praw) (2.0.7)\n","Requirement already satisfied: certifi>=2017.4.17 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from requests<3.0,>=2.6.0->prawcore<3,>=2.1->praw) (2023.7.22)\n","Installing collected packages: update-checker, prawcore, praw\n","Successfully installed praw-7.7.1 prawcore-2.4.0 update-checker-0.18.0\n"]}],"source":["import pandas as pd\n","import time\n","import datetime\n","!pip install praw\n","import praw\n","import praw.exceptions"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"EGko55jjM3Ny"},"source":["### Step 2: Authenticating with the Reddit API\n","\n","To access Reddit's data programmatically, we need to authenticate our Python application using the `praw` library.

Before executing the code, it's essential to ensure that the necessary libraries are installed and Reddit API credentials are correctly configured.\n","\n","### Parameters\n","\n","- **Subreddit name**: Identify which subreddit you are interested in. Use 'all' to search the entire Reddit.\n","\n","- **Total Posts to Retrieve**: The variable `total_posts_to_retrieve` is initially set to 1,000 in this example. You can customize it to suit your specific data collection requirements, but be aware that, because of Reddit limitations, the maximum available posts is only 250.\n","\n","- **Time Filter**: The code applies a time filter to retrieve posts within a specified time frame, such as 'year.' You can modify the `time_filter` variable to focus on a different time period. Choose among: 'all', 'day', 'hour', 'month', 'week', or 'year'.\n","\n","- **Sort mode**: The variable `sort_mode` can be set to 'relevance', 'hot', 'top', 'new', or 'comments', depending on the kind of data you wish to access.\n","\n","- **Keywords**: The `keywords` variable identifies the keywords used in the search.\n","\n","- **Batch Size**: The `batch_size` variable dictates the number of posts fetched in each batch.

Calculate the number of remaining posts to retrieve in the current batch.\n","\n","2. Issue an API request to search for posts, utilizing the 'after' parameter for pagination purposes.\n","\n","3. Perform a check to determine if there are additional posts to retrieve. If the query returns no more results, the loop concludes.\n","\n","4. Append the retrieved posts to the `all_posts` list, continuously building the dataset.\n","\n","5. Keep track of counts to monitor the number of posts retrieved and the current batch being processed.\n","\n","6.

It utilizes the Python Reddit API Wrapper (PRAW) library and the information obtained from the previous steps. The explanation of the code is as follows:\n","\n","### Data Retrieval Loop -- **'extract_comments' function**\n","\n","The data retrieval process unfolds in a sequence of steps:\n","\n","1. Iterate through the different post's unique identifier (`post_id`) as a parameter.\n","\n","2. Within the function, a Reddit post submission is retrieved using the provided `post_id`. This submission object represents the specific post on Reddit.\n","\n","3. To ensure all comments are retrieved, the code uses `submission.comments.replace_more(limit=None)` to replace more comments. This is necessary because Reddit employs a \"load more comments\" mechanism that can hide some comments from direct retrieval. This function effectively retrieves all comments.\n","\n","4. he code then iterates through the comments using a list comprehension.
